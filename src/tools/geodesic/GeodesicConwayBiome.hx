/**
	The geodesic sphere, wired up as an actual playable `Biome` — steps 2
	and 4 of `docs/building/notes/geodesic-sphere-engineering.md`'s own
	"wiring into the real game" list.

	**Deliberately reuses `ConwayBiome.ID`.** `biomes.hub.ConwayWaypoint`
	references the id string, not the class, and reuses `ConwayBiome`'s
	own tuned `GRAVITY`/`STEP_INTERVAL`/`backgroundColor` rather than
	re-deriving them: none of that tuning was ever about the grid's shape.

	**Two spheres, not one (2026-08-06) — the "coarse maze" wall-
	straightening attempt, moved here from `GeodesicPreview` once it had
	nothing further to prove standalone.** `fineSphere` still carries the
	floor tessellation and the Life simulation, unchanged since Phase 6.
	A separate, coarser `coarseSphere` carries the maze itself — carving,
	reactivity, and now collision too. `GeodesicCoarseMaze.fineToCoarse`
	assigns every fine cell to the coarse region it falls inside; walls
	render only where that assignment crosses a coarse boundary
	(`GeodesicCoarseMaze.wallSegments`), and `GeodesicCollision.tryMove`'s
	own `fineToCoarse` parameter remaps the player's fine position before
	checking the coarse layout — so what blocks the player and what's
	drawn as a wall are the same coarse edge, not approximations of each
	other. See `GeodesicCoarseMaze`'s own doc for the full reasoning, and
	`docs/archive/decisions.md` for why a first
	attempt (`GeodesicWallSimplifier`, merging wall geometry after the
	fact) was retracted rather than fixed.

	**Ventrella rule (2026-08-09) — replaces the earlier `GeodesicLifeState`/B2/S34
	engine.** `GeodesicGliderSearchMultiRule`'s own exhaustive 2-ring search
	found zero confirmed travelers under any 2-state rule tried (B2/S34,
	B24/S46, B35/S2) in the 3-5 cell range, where Jeffrey Ventrella's own
	published 4-state hex-CA (`https://www.ventrella.com/SphereCA/`)
	demonstrates a period-2 glider that survives collisions on this exact
	topology — see `GeodesicVentrellaState`'s own doc for the full
	rationale.

	**Scripted glider spawns, not ambient soup (2026-08-09, same day, second
	revision).** First tried ambient random seeding (matching what
	`GeodesicVentrellaState.seed` is built for) — measured badly in play
	("very much 'not much' happening... random isolated cells birth, then
	die," `docs/archive/decisions.md`'s own entry has
	the numbers: every density from `0.1` to `1.0` collapsed to `~0.1%`
	population). The fix wasn't a better density — it was reproducing
	Ventrella's own documented glider directly (hand-reconstructed from a
	description of the source paper's own Figure 2, self-verified before
	trusting it) and confirming it actually travels on this mesh — chord
	drift up to `1.812` on a unit sphere before looping back around and
	colliding with its own launch site. `GeodesicVentrellaGliderSpawner`
	now reseeds that confirmed shape from 12 sites (one per pentagon, each
	its own heading, staggered clocks) every tick; `state.step` runs with
	`noRandomBirths` the same way the old `GeodesicGliderTracker`-driven
	design once did, so the board's population is entirely attributable to
	deliberate spawns, never ambient noise. `GeodesicLifeState`/`GeodesicLifeRule`/
	`GeodesicGliderTracker`/every tool built on the old engine are untouched
	and still compile — a complete, trivially-revertible fallback, the same
	precedent this class's own doc already set when it replaced
	`biomes.conway.ConwayBiome`.

	**Smooth live-cell blocks, not per-generation pops (2026-08-10).**
	Reported directly after the spawner shipped: "the whole thing feels
	like it's stuttering, since cells move only at each tick." Live cell
	blocks used to rebuild once per `STEP_INTERVAL` alongside the floor/walls,
	so a block appeared or vanished in a single frame. `previousStages`/
	`currentStages` now snapshot `GeodesicLifecycle.stagesOf` at each
	generation boundary, and `rebuildLiveCells` — called every `tick`, at
	the engine's own 60Hz fixed-update cadence (`Main.FIXED_DT`), not the
	0.75s generation step — rebuilds just the live-cell meshes with height
	lerped between those two snapshots via `GeodesicMesh.buildLiveCells`.
	Collision (`applyGravity`'s own `GeodesicLifecycle.groundHeightOf`)
	deliberately still reads the discrete, post-step `state` directly, never
	interpolated — smoothing is a visual-only concern; blending jump timing
	against a fractional block height would make it feel mushy, not smooth.
	The floor/walls (`container`/`rebuildMesh`) are unaffected — genuinely
	static between generations, so still only rebuilt when a step actually
	happens, cheap relative to a per-frame live-cell rebuild whose own cost
	stays bounded by population size, not `sphere.neighbors.length`.

	**Thick walls need a matching clearance check (2026-08-10).** Reported
	after the smoothing fix: "we still see cells through walls," even with
	depth-write already correct — traced to `GeodesicMesh.addWall` building a
	single zero-thickness quad, which vanishes at grazing viewing angles no
	matter how depth/blend state is set. `GeodesicMesh.addWall` now extrudes
	a real slab (`GeodesicMesh.WALL_THICKNESS`), but `GeodesicCollision.tryMove`
	was purely graph-based — "which cell am I in" — with no distance buffer,
	so thickening the render geometry alone would let the camera end up
	*inside* it. `boundarySegments` (`GeodesicCoarseMaze.boundarySegmentsByFineNode`,
	computed once here since it's static geometry) indexes wall segments by
	fine node so `tryMove` can reject a move that lands too close to a
	*closed* one — see `GeodesicCollision`'s own doc for the "never trap the
	player" safety net that makes this an actual guarantee, not just a
	usual-case mitigation.

	**`serialize`/`restore`.** `fineSphere`/`coarseSphere`/`fineToCoarse`/
	`boundaryEdges`/`boundarySegments`/lookups aren't part of the save —
	every session derives them fresh from the same checked-in baked asset
	plus the same `COARSE_FREQUENCY`, so persisting a copy would be pure
	redundancy.
	`gliderSpawner` likewise isn't persisted — its 12 sites are a pure
	function of the checked-in sphere's own pentagon positions, so a fresh
	instance reconstructs identically. What *is* persisted:
	`coarseLayout.openEdges`, the coarse core edge set
	(`GeodesicReactivity.coreEdgeKeys`/`fromCoreKeys` — a save has no
	"freshly carved" layout lying around, so the immutable core set has to
	travel on its own), the Ventrella state, `generation` (so a restored
	save's spawn sites stay on the same clock rather than resetting to
	phase `0`), and the tick accumulator.

	**Pentagon composing (2026-08-10).** Player-authored counterpart to
	`gliderSpawner`'s own ambient shape — see `GeodesicPentagonEngraving`'s
	own doc for the full mechanic and `docs/open/ideas-backlog.md`'s
	"Deliberate pentagon activation" entry for the design conversation
	behind it. `interact` toggles `editingPentagon` on/off (entering only
	from a pentagon node itself, per `fineLookup.nodeAt`); `cameraOverride`
	dollies the camera in toward it while editing, and `capturesInput`
	reports the engraving being open, which is what `GameLoop` reads to
	suspend normal movement/turning and switch the mouse out of
	pointer-lock for clicking; `onEditClick` resolves a click's
	own ray against the sphere analytically (`raySphereIntersection`)
	and toggles whichever footprint cell it lands on. `engraving.tickAll`
	runs every `tick` unconditionally — a composed pentagon keeps
	restamping itself onto the live board whether or not the player is
	currently there, deliberately, so it acts as a sustaining source rather
	than a one-shot seed. `accumulator`'s own `while` loop (the
	simulation's real generation-advance) is skipped entirely while
	`editingPentagon != null`, so composing a pattern happens against a
	frozen board — the "freeze while zoomed in" the design conversation
	asked for; `engraving.tickAll`'s own restamp clock is unaffected by
	that freeze (it runs on real ticks, not generations), so a pentagon's
	pattern still restamps on schedule even while another pentagon is
	being edited. Not yet persisted across `serialize`/`restore` — an open
	gap, not a considered omission; a composed pattern is currently lost on
	reload the same way `gliderSpawner`'s sites *aren't* (those are a pure
	function of the sphere, this is genuine player state).
