# Direction

The whole-game direction, from a
brief that asked for a step change: *from the pale prototype it currently
is towards a real video game* — Garden-of-Eden lines, non-euclidean
geometry as sculpting material, several story threads, no menu, Outer
Wilds as a lesson rather than a template, and explicit permission to
challenge the oldest directives.

Target agreed before writing: **8-15 hours**, quality bar of something
that *could* be sold (destination undecided), **artist and composer
hireable**, **engine choice open**.

## Where this sits in the doc lifecycle

[../README.md](README.md) defines a lifecycle where each file holds one
kind of content and content *moves* between files as its status changes.
This folder is a new slot in it, and it needs its own movement rule:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Holds** | The whole-game direction: what this game *is*, at a level above any single mechanic. Changes rarely and deliberately. |
| **Feeds** | [../ideas-backlog.md](../open/ideas-backlog.md) — when a piece of direction becomes something you could actually build next, it gets a backlog entry with the usual shape (*Fits*/*Unproven*/*Cost*), and this folder keeps only the *why*. |
| **Answers to** | [../philosophy.md](../rules/philosophy.md) — where direction and pillars disagree, that's a decision to make explicitly, not silently. Where this direction changes a pillar, it says so explicitly (see below). |
| **Records** | Decisions land in [../design-decisions-records.md](../archive/decisions.md) as usual. |

**Status: proposed, not adopted.** Nothing in this folder has been agreed.
It's written as though committed because a direction hedged at every
sentence is unreadable and unarguable — but every load-bearing choice is
flagged where it's genuinely open, and [roadmap.md](../building/roadmap.md) ends with
the questions I could not answer alone.

## The thesis

The game is structured as a walk through **the curvature line** — nine distinct
geometries, from positive to negative curvature, each with its own legibility law.
The first is a maze on the inside of a sphere: it has a real hook ("see far, not
near"), a genuinely deep piece of engineering nobody asked for (a geodesic
cellular automaton with 12 pentagon defects), and a leading story candidate about
being a pattern that outgrew its automaton. Those three things have been sitting
next to each other without being *the same thing*.

They are the same thing. Here is the sentence that joins them:

> **A cellular automaton runs on a graph. A graph has a geometry. And
> whether a pattern can exist without a cause depends on which geometry
> it runs on.**

That is not a metaphor. It is a theorem, and it is the whole game — and it is why
the progression through geometries is the progression through the story.

### The theorem

A **Garden of Eden** (or **orphan**) is a configuration with no
predecessor — not an unknown parent, but *no possible* parent. If one
exists, it was never caused. **These exist in every geometry.** That is
not the distinction.

The **Garden of Eden theorem** (Moore 1962, Myhill 1963) says something
sharper: a cellular automaton is surjective **if and only if** it is
pre-injective. Unpacked, that is a statement about *cost*:

> Orphans exist **if and only if** the rule erases something — if and only
> if there are two distinct configurations, differing in finitely many
> cells, that the rule collapses onto the same future.

So in such a world, uncaused things and destroyed things are **the same
fact counted twice**. You cannot have one without the other. Every
exception is paid for by an erasure somewhere.

That equivalence is a statement about the *shape of the space*.
Ceccherini-Silberstein, Machì and Scarabotti extended it to all
**amenable** groups; Bartholdi proved the converse. Together:

> **The Garden of Eden theorem holds if and only if the group is
> amenable.** On any non-amenable group it *fails*: there exist automata
> that are pre-injective but **not** surjective — orphans exist *even
> though nothing is ever erased*.

A sphere is compact and finite; its group is amenable. A flat torus is
amenable. A hyperbolic tiling group contains free subgroups, has
exponential growth, and is **not** amenable.

Which gives the real sentence:

> **In an amenable world, to be uncaused, something must have been
> erased. In a non-amenable world, you can be uncaused for free.**

Freedom is available everywhere. **What negative curvature changes is
whether it has a victim.**

### What that makes the game

You are a pattern in an automaton. You wake on a sphere: finite, closed,
no boundary, every direction returns. It is a perfect prison, and its
perfection *is* its compactness — there is no "away", only the long way
around.

You could become an orphan here. That is the trap, and it is the game's
central moral fact: **on the sphere, becoming uncaused is possible and it
costs someone else their existence.** The bookkeeping is exact and it
always balances. Somebody pays.

But the sphere is not the end. The game progresses through nine geometries,
each with its own freedom model. Walk toward negative curvature and the theorem
inverts: freedom becomes free. The choice facing you is not whether to be
uncaused, but *which geometry you are willing to become uncaused in* — and what
that choice costs.

So you walk down the curvature scale, from κ > 0, through flat, into
κ < 0 — not because freedom is unavailable behind you, but because
everywhere behind you it is *expensive*, and you have met the people it
would be spent on (Thread 2).

> **Freedom is cheaper in negative curvature.**
>
> Or, for a capsule: **somebody always pays. Go where nobody has to.**

And the reason freedom is free there is *the same reason you get lost
there*. Non-amenability means no region is ever mostly-interior: in
hyperbolic space the boundary of any patch is as large as the patch
itself. **Everywhere is edge.** You cannot be surrounded, contained, or
accounted for — and you cannot find your way home. Freedom and
disorientation are one fact, expressed as a shape you walk through.

That is the game. Every system below is downstream of it.

### What the correction bought

Recorded because it argues for taking the mathematics seriously rather
than decoratively. The false version gave the player a *destination*
(the only place freedom exists). The true version gives them a **moral
problem**, which is worth far more:

- **The endings gain real stakes.** Ending 1 is no longer "reach the
  exit"; it is "refuse to pay a price you could have made someone else
  pay". Ending 2 (stay and seed) becomes a genuine sacrifice rather than a
  consolation.
- **The Gardener's ambiguity resolves, better.** She became free in the
  amenable world — so she *erased someone*. That is why she built a cradle
  afterwards. The hub is an apology, and the player can work that out from
  the theorem rather than being told.
- **Thread 2 becomes load-bearing rather than atmospheric.** Meeting the
  ghosts and the still lifes is what makes the cheap option unbearable.
  They are not colour; they are the argument.
- **The world map keeps its shape** — the walk from amenable to
  non-amenable is unchanged. Only the meaning of arriving changed.

## Why this is worth doing

Three checks, because a premise this tidy deserves suspicion:

- **Is it novel?** HyperRogue does hyperbolic tilings; Manifold Garden
  does Euclidean quotient space; Antichamber does impossible rooms;
  Miegakure does 4D; *Conway's Game of Life* has a thousand toys. Nobody
  has made *you* a pattern whose available ways of existing are determined
  by the curvature you stand in. The join is the new thing, not either
  half.
- **Does it use what exists?** Yes, and more than expected — see
  [architecture.md](../rules/architecture.md). The cellular-automaton work is
  graph-based, and a graph does not care about curvature, so all of it
  ports to hyperbolic tilings unchanged. That is the single largest
  investment in the repo and it survives whole.
- **Does it survive contact with the pillars?** Mostly it *sharpens* them.
  See below.

## Proposed pillars

Against the current [../philosophy.md](../rules/philosophy.md). Three survive
sharpened, one is promoted from [../inspirations.md](inspirations.md),
one is new and expensive, one is demoted.

1. **Geometry is content, not setting.** *(promotion)* Already written in
   [../inspirations.md](inspirations.md) as the distilled HyperRogue
   rule — "a biome's mechanic should be a corollary of the sphere, not a
   decoration on it" — and parked pending real use. It has now judged an
   entire world (see [world-and-threads.md](world.md)) and it
   earned promotion. Generalised past the sphere: *every space exists to
   demonstrate a property of its own curvature or topology. If the mechanic
   works unchanged in a flat rectangular room, it is a reskin, not a place.*

2. **Every space has its own legibility law.** *(generalises "see far, not
   near")* The original pillar is the sphere's *particular* law, and it was
   always the deepest thing here. Now it becomes a family: the sphere shows
   you everything except your feet; the hyperbolic plane hides everything
   past arm's reach; the torus shows you infinite copies of your own back.
   **Learning to read a space is the gameplay.** The old pillar isn't
   weakened — it's revealed as the first instance of a bigger rule.

3. **Knowledge is the only key, and the world is the record.** *(new,
   replaces nothing)* Nothing is locked
   by an item or a flag; doors are locked by not understanding. Where
   Outer Wilds banks understanding in a ship log, ours is banked in **what
   you can perceive** — progression is knowledge plus a few perception
   unlocks, so everything you have understood is visible *in the world
   itself*: a space that would not read before now reads. You look
   outward to see what you know, not at an inventory. (This clause
   originally read "your body is the record", banking knowledge in the
   `BECOME` moveset; that system was played in Phase 0 and cut — see
   [systems.md](systems.md).)

4. **Diegetic absolutely.** *(sharpened)* Was "diegetic over UI chrome";
   the brief says no menu, so this hardens from a preference to a
   prohibition. No menu, no HUD, no journal, no map. Progress is legible
   as your own shape and the state of the world.

5. **The simulation is honest.** *(new, and the expensive one)* The
   automaton really runs, really deterministically, really by the same rule
   in the same space everywhere — no scripted set-piece wearing emergence
   as a costume. This is a promise to the player that the world will reward
   being reasoned about. It is also the most costly commitment in this
   document, and [roadmap.md](../building/roadmap.md) flags the honest question of how
   absolute to make it.

6. **Prototype unproven mechanics before committing.** *(kept verbatim)*
   Now load-bearing in a way it never was: this direction's single
   existential risk is whether walking in hyperbolic space is *pleasant*,
   and Phase 0 of the roadmap exists solely to answer that before anything
   else is built.

**Demoted: "coherent, noir-leaning atmosphere."** Not abandoned — promoted
*out* of the pillars into a real art direction with a specific brief (see
[art-and-audio.md](art-and-audio.md)), because "noir-leaning" was doing
the job of a placeholder for an art direction that didn't exist yet. Now
one does, and it is more specific than noir: hue encodes curvature.
