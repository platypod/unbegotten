		transformed, by the same isometry, or the view would spin at the
		seam.

		Nothing about the transition is visible: the identification is by
		an isometry and the world is drawn on both sides of the seam, so
		the scene is continuous across it. The player's controls are not
		reflected either, which is the design's own point — *your
		handedness is not a property you carry*. The only tell is the room:
		the bright rail is now on the other side (see `TurnMesh`).

		`forward` is transformed as a **direction**, not a point — see
		`TurnModel.directionToModel`, which zeroes the homogeneous
		coordinate so the glide's translation drops out and only its
		reflection applies. Transforming it as a point would fling the
		facing a full period away and leave `forward` no longer a unit
		vector.
		@param player the player to wrap.
		@return true if an identification was applied — i.e. the player just changed lift, and with it their own handedness.
