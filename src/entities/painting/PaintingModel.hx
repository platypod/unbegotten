/**
	A painting mounted on a wall — the diegetic warp mechanism: walking
	close enough triggers the transition, no interact-key confirmation, on
	purpose (see `docs/archive/project-log.md`'s 2026-07-17 entry — finding one
	should still take some searching rather than being telegraphed by a
	prompt; flagged there as revisitable later).

	Pure data plus the trigger check — actually building a painting's
	visible quad is scene/rendering code (see `buildQuad`), kept separate so
	the trigger math itself stays unit-testable without needing a scene
	graph (`docs/rules/guidelines.md` §1.4/§5.4).

	An `Entity` since it's a thing that exists in the game world with a
	position — but only the warp-linked shape is built here
	(`destinationBiomeId`/`triggerDistance`); a purely decorative painting
	with no mechanism behind it isn't a real use case yet, so this doesn't
	try to anticipate what that would look like (same discipline as
	`CreatureSpawnTable`'s own doc).

		and theta as the wall, just a different phi), barely lifting the
		inset off the wall at all — visible as the painting reading as

		@param imageUpMatchesUp whether `up` (or its default) actually matches the direction a *nearby player* perceives as up — true for every straight wall this project has so far (the flat `FlatSpace` biomes, and ordinary radial walls, both keep the two in sync), false for the hub's own column: its face panels need `up = (0,1,0)` to stay flush with the panel's own vertical extrusion, but a player standing near enough to read a face-mounted painting is near the sphere's own pole, where *their* up (`SphereSpace`'s "toward center") points close to the opposite direction — mounting the artwork's own top row at the geometrically-flush end there reads as upside down (reported directly). Pass `false` to swap which edge gets the texture's own top row instead of its bottom, without touching the geometry at all.

		Like `buildQuad`, but for a painting mounted on a section of a

		one: `segments` flat facets swept around the arc instead of a
		single flat chord, so the artwork's own surface follows the wall's
		real curvature — the flat-quad version has to sit inset off a
		*chord*, which bulges away from the actual curved wall behind it
		by the arc's own sagitta, `radius * (1 - cos(halfAngle))`; wide
		enough (relative to `radius`) and that gap either shows through
		the wall (if it undershoots `SURFACE_INSET`) or lets the wall
		visibly poke past the painting (if it overshoots it) — the exact
		bug `biomes.hub.TowerReplica`'s own `PAINTING_HALF_ANGLE` doc walks
		through fighting via ever-smaller angles. Sweeping the artwork
		around the same curve the wall itself follows removes the
		chord-vs-arc mismatch outright instead of just keeping it small.

		Same UV mapping as `buildQuad` (continuous top-to-bottom, and
		`0` to `1` across the whole arc rather than repeating per facet)
		so the artwork reads at the same size/resolution as a flat mount
		would, just bent to fit — not stretched, shrunk, or tiled
		differently. No `roomCenter`/`imageUpMatchesUp` parameters (unlike
		`buildQuad`): the wall this mounts on is always the *outside* of a

		and vertical are genuinely different units here (an angle and a

		`outerBorder` scalars, an arc-based frame keeps them as two

		shared linear distance to stand in for both.
