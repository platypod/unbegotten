/**
	**The Turn** — a flat, genuinely non-orientable band. See
	[the design](../../../docs/game/world.md)'s
	own entry (`### 4. The Turn`).

	**Built against the design's own stated ordering.** That entry carries
	two open problems and is explicit about which comes first: the
	chirality mechanism cannot be judged until traversal is proven
	tolerable, because "a bad ribbon kills a good mechanic here". So this
	prototype is the ribbon. What it answers is *is going round repeatedly
	pleasant*, and it deliberately does not build the glider-annihilation
	puzzle on top of an unproven answer.

	**A proposal, flagged as one.** The design leaves open how the player
	discovers their own current handedness "cheaply enough that testing it
	isn't itself the boring part", and calls marks-as-reference the
	leading but unsettled candidate. This build offers a cheaper answer:
	**the band's single boundary curve is painted pale for one period and
	dashed for the next**, so which rail is beside you tells you which
	lift you are on — no instrument, no memory, no detour, read in a
	glance at speed. See `TurnMesh`, including the correction to how I
	first described it. If it works it should go into the design doc; if
	it feels like being told rather than discovering, the marks idea is
	still there.

	**Locomotion, the harder problem.** The design names two ways out and
	takes neither: make movement itself the pleasure (*Race the Sun*), or
	give each lap its own skill. This takes both, cheaply — the biome
	moves at `SPEED_MULTIPLIER` times normal walking speed, and the band
	is strewn with obstacles to weave through on a rhythm. That the rhythm
	arrives **mirrored** after each lap is what stops the second lap being
	the first lap again, which is the specific failure the design warns
	about.

	Left standing beside `biomes.mobius.MobiusBiome` rather than replacing
	it — see `TurnModel` for why the embedded version is not flat and this
	one is, and why both are worth having.
