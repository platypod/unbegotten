/**
	**The Knot** — a closed hyperbolic surface of genus 2. See
	[the design](../../../docs/game/world.md)'s
	own entry (`### 8. The Knot`), which files it as late-game mastery:
	the space that proves you have learned to think in geometries rather
	than in maps.

	**The one thing that separates this from the Sprawl.** Both are
	hyperbolic and both look, locally, exactly alike. But the Sprawl goes
	on forever and every cell is somewhere new, while this surface is
	*closed* and **every octagon you can see is the same octagon** —
	there is one room here, and you are looking at many images of it. Walk
	in any direction and you come back. Which is why the design's
	legibility law for this space is that position is insufficient and you
	must track your *route*: "where am I" has the same answer everywhere,
	and the honest answer is a word in a group rather than a point.

	**Why the landmark is asymmetric and off-centre.** With identical
	content in every copy, the only readable information is *orientation*
	— which image of the room you are looking at, and how it is turned
	relative to you. A symmetric landmark would make the images
	indistinguishable and the space unreadable rather than merely hard.

	Reuses the Sprawl's whole spatial and rendering approach unchanged
	(`HyperbolicSpace`, `HyperbolicView`, a camera pinned at the origin
	with the world transformed around it) — see
	`biomes.sprawl.SprawlBiome` for why hyperbolic rendering has to work
	that way. What is new here is only *which* group the copies come from.

	**Not built:** anything that uses the two handles. The design's verb
	is `braid`, and distinguishing two independent families of loop is the
	content this space exists for. What is here answers the prior
	question — whether a closed hyperbolic surface reads as closed at all
	from inside it.
