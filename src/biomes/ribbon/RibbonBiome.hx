/**
	**The Ribbon** — a world that is a *line*, whose second walkable axis
	is time. See
	[the design](../../../docs/game/world.md)'s
	own entry (`### 6. The Ribbon`).

	The ground is the spacetime diagram of an elementary cellular
	automaton (`RibbonAutomaton`, Rule 110), laid out generation by
	generation: **walking north walks into the past**. Every live cell of
	every generation is a raised slab, so the history the player is
	standing on is legible as relief. Walk far enough and the diagram
	thins to the single cell of generation `0` — the initial condition,
	which somebody typed — and then the ground stops.

	Tonally the odd one out on purpose: a museum, or a graveyard, rather
	than a place with weather. Nothing here moves. Every other biome in
	the game ticks; this one is the only place whose contents are already
	finished, which is what makes it read as the past rather than as more
	present.

	**Geometrically it is the simplest biome in the game**, and that is
	the point of building it now. `FlatSpace` already existed, gravity
	against a heightfield is `Gravity.fallToSurface`'s own `groundHeight`
	parameter (which `biomes.hub.HubBiome` already uses to stand on
	walls), and collision is a per-axis clamp. Almost nothing here is new
	machinery — the interesting content is the *idea*, and it was worth
	finding out how cheaply the idea could be made walkable.
