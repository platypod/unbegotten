/**
	The Weft's one authored idea: **every wall answers to the wall at its
	antipode, and the two are always in opposite states.**

	**No manifold trick.** The sphere is the same sphere the Fold walks —
	nothing is glued, there is exactly one of the player, and every
	location is where you would expect it to be. What is added is a *rule
	laid over* the geometry, which is precisely what
	`docs/game/world.md` says the space is
	for: the correspondence is authored, has no geometric necessity behind
	it, and is therefore the first evidence in the game that *someone
	decided these two things would answer to each other*.

	That entry also carries a correction worth not undoing. This space was
	once "the projective plane, walkable" — a real quotient — and that was
	abandoned because a quotient has only *one* wall per identified edge,
	so there is nothing for it to be opposite *to*. Everything here keeps
	two distinct walls at two distinct places.

	**Where the rule cannot apply, and why that is geometry rather than
	laziness.** `GridModel`'s rows carry different column counts by
	latitude, and the two rows nearest each pole have an **odd** count
	(`COLS / 4` = 7). The antipodal map shifts a row by half its columns,
	which on an odd row lands on a cell *boundary* rather than a cell — so
	the map is not an involution there, and no fixed-point-free pairing of
	an odd number of cells exists at all. Those rows are simply unpaired.
	The design's own "Exists" note anticipates a pole edge case; this is
	it, in the exact place it predicted.

		Forces the invariant across the whole sphere: **a paired wall and

		**The northern hemisphere generates; the southern hemisphere is its
		mirror.** Within each antipodal pair, the edge in the north (per
		`isNorthern`) is left exactly as the base carve made it; its
		southern partner is forced to the opposite. `antipodeOf` maps row
		`r` to row `13 - r`, so this split is total — a paired edge is
		always north-with-south, never north-with-north — except the single
		row boundary sitting exactly on the equator, which pairs with
		itself in that sense and falls back to comparing edge keys, same as
		this function used to do everywhere.

		**An earlier version of this split was by edge key alone**, scattered
		arbitrarily across the whole sphere rather than by hemisphere — technically
		satisfying the invariant, but with no relationship a player standing
		anywhere could actually see: the "authoritative" edge near them was
		as likely to be the one forced from its partner as the one setting
		it, so the far side read as unrelated noise rather than a legible
		negative. That was flagged directly ("no symmetry in the maze").
		The hemisphere split is what the design always described — *the far
		side of the world is the photographic negative of the near side* —
		made into the actual generating rule instead of an emergent
		description of a scattered one.

		Pleasantly, both sides still read as mazes. A spanning-tree carve
		opens roughly half a grid's edges, so its complement is also
		roughly half — the negative hemisphere is not the open plain one
		might expect.

		**Connectivity is not preserved, and that is left standing.** The
		carve guarantees every cell is reachable; complementing half the
		edges destroys that guarantee, so the negative side can hold loops
		and sealed pockets. It is survivable rather than a bug, because
		this space's whole verb is opening walls: a player enclosed
		anywhere paired can always toggle their way out. A Weft that wants
		an authored *puzzle* will need its own generator — carve,
		complement, then repair — rather than the Fold's.
