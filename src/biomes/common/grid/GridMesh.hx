/**
	Builds renderable meshes for a grid-based biome's own layout: a floor
	patch per ring cell, and a wall wherever an edge between two
	grid-adjacent nodes is closed.

	The floor uses each cell's outer corners (`cornersOf`) unchanged — full
	size, same as before thickness existed — except at a doubling boundary,
	where it also picks up its neighbor's own split points along that edge
	(see `addFloor`) so the two sides tessellate identically instead of
	leaving a crack. Walls are drawn *per cell, per side* rather than once
	per shared edge: each cell also has its own inner
	corners (`innerCornersOf`, inset from the outer ones by WALL_THICKNESS),
	and a closed side draws a piece spanning outer-to-inner on *that cell's
	own* territory only. A closed edge between cells A and B is therefore two
	pieces, one from each side, meeting exactly at the shared outer boundary
	— never overlapping, since neither extends past it, and the floor
	underneath simply goes unseen in the strip a wall covers (no need to
	inset the floor to match).

	This replaced an earlier version that built one box per closed *edge*,
	offset outward from the boundary along that edge's own length direction.
	Independent per-edge offsets meant two edges meeting at a shared corner
	(a plain corner, or worse, three-plus edges at a pole-adjacent junction)
	computed *different* offset points for what was nominally the same
	corner — visible overlap between the resulting boxes, confirmed
	in-browser as a shaky/flickering seam wherever two textured, overlapping
	faces fought over the same depth. A follow-up patch tried patching this
	with a corner post at every wall endpoint (sized to the wall thickness,
	filling whatever gap or overlap was there) — better, but the post itself
	still overlapped every wall piece meeting it, same shakiness at smaller
	scale. Building per-cell from each cell's own two consistent corner sets
	(used by all four of that cell's potential sides) removes the overlap at
	the source instead of patching over it: within one cell, adjacent sides
	share the exact same inner/outer corner, so they meet edge-to-edge, and
	between cells, both sides' pieces stop exactly at the shared outer
	boundary they're built from.

	Each piece is up to 4 quads: the inner face (visible to a player standing
	in the cell), the top cap (visible once pitching up puts a wall's top
	edge in view — the "see across the sphere" mechanic), and up to two end
	caps sealing the piece where it's a genuine free-standing end — skipped
	wherever the wall meeting it there is also closed, so a plain corner
	stays a plain rectangular corner rather than getting chamfered by two
	overlapping diagonal cap faces (see `maybeAddPiece`'s own doc). No outer
	face: it would sit exactly where the neighboring cell's own piece for
	the same edge begins, so it's never actually visible from either side,
	only wasted overlapping geometry.

	Unlit and double-sided (so the sphere's inward-facing geometry doesn't get
	backface-culled away) — material.color + enableLights=false still let the
	PBR technique's other lighting/falloff terms through (no scene light, but
	every face's shading still depended on its normal, which the Polygon
	primitive never had set, producing a smooth gradient and half-dark faces
	instead of a flat tone). The floor and walls both sample a texture
	through `graphics.shaders.UnlitTexture` — grass and stone respectively —
	rather than any lighting-pipeline shader, for that same reason.

		to this cell alone: the neighboring cell across any given side has
		its own, different inner corners, inset from the *same* outer
		boundary in the opposite direction — that's what a wall's thickness
		actually is, split between the two cells it separates.

		The phi inset accounts for the sphere's curvature (a cell's
		circumference shrinks toward the poles at fixed angular width, same
		distortion `cornersOf`'s fixed `halfPhi` already has) so it's a
		consistent linear WALL_THICKNESS at any latitude, not a fixed angle —
		computed separately for the north pair and the south pair, each at
		*that edge's own* theta (`theta -/+ halfTheta`), not this cell's
		center theta. Using center theta for all four corners was the
		original approach, and is wrong: a west/east wall's own north and
		south ends sit at the row's actual boundaries, not its center, so the
		curvature correction there needs the boundary's own sine, not the
		center's. Using the center's sine instead made a west/east piece's
		north-end inner corner land at a different phi than the next row's
		own south-end inner corner for that exact same boundary — each row
		computing the correction from its own center rather than the shared
		latitude — so adjacent rows' walls shared their outer edge exactly
		but diverged on the inner edge, a visible seam (in cross-section, two
		wedges joined only along the outer line) at every row boundary.
		Computing each pair from its own true theta makes both sides of a
		boundary agree, since `row`'s own south theta (`theta + halfTheta`)
		is bit-identical to `row + 1`'s own north theta (`theta - halfTheta`
		there) — same latitude, same formula, same result.

		Clamped to the cell's own half-width so a cell doesn't invert near a
		pole, where a column could otherwise be physically narrower than
		WALL_THICKNESS itself — much less likely now that `GridModel.colsForRow`
		reduces column count near the poles specifically to keep cell width
		from collapsing there, but still a real possibility for a small or
		oddly-tuned `WALL_THICKNESS`, so the clamp stays.

		`retreatNorth`/`retreatSouth` control whether the *theta* axis
		retreats from that end at all — a west/east wall only needs room
		there when something is actually using it: a real corner (the
		perpendicular side is closed) or a genuine dead end. When the same
		west/east wall instead runs straight through into the next row
		(nothing perpendicular there, and the next row's own matching side
		is also closed), retreating anyway pinches the piece into a wedge
		that only touches its neighbor along the outer edge — see
		`WallBuilder.continuesAcrossRowBoundary`. Passing `false` there
		keeps that end at the *full* outer theta instead, flush with
		whatever continues it. The phi inset is unaffected either way —
		it's the wall's thickness, not conditional on what's next door.

		see its own doc): only this cell's outermost west or east corner

		Adds this cell's piece(s) for its north (`towardNorth = true`) or

		`GridModel.rowBoundaryNeighbors` entry, each spanning only that entry's
		own fraction of this cell's phi width (matching whichever of
		`otherRow`'s cells actually borders it there), rather than assuming
		a single neighbor spans the whole side the way west/east always do.

		An entry's `phiStart`/`phiEnd` are already this cell's true *outer*
		boundary phi for that fraction (`GridModel.rowBoundaryNeighbors` computes
		them the same way `cornersOf` does) — used directly for the outer
		corners. The matching *inner* corners need the same fraction applied
		to this cell's own inner phi range instead, so a split piece still
		tapers the same way a whole one does — computed by re-deriving each
		entry's fraction of the *outer* range and applying it to the *inner*
		one. That inset phi range uses this side's own boundary theta
		(`outerTheta`) for the curvature correction, not this cell's center
		theta — matching `innerCornersOf`'s own fix for the same reason:
		this side's west/east ends have to land on the exact same points
		`innerCornersOf` computes for this cell's west/east pieces, or the
		two would meet at a corner with mismatched inner edges again, just
		relocated from a row boundary to a west/east one.

		The inner range's own west and east ends independently retreat (or
		not) the same way a west/east piece's north/south ends do (see
		`continuesAcrossColumnBoundary`): retreat only where a real
		perpendicular wall needs the room or the side is a genuine dead
		end, and run the full outer width through where this same
		north/south wall instead continues straight into the next column —
		otherwise it pinches into a wedge at *every* column it crosses the
		same way an unfixed west/east wall pinched at every row.

		Each entry's end caps are skipped wherever whatever's adjacent to it
		there is also closed or flush (see `maybeAddPiece`'s doc): its
		outermost (westmost/eastmost) end against this cell's own west/east
		wall (or its continuation), and — when this side is itself split
		into more than one entry — each interior end against its
		neighboring entry, so two closed sub-pieces of the *same* logical

		perpendicular one.
