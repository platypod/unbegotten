/**
	The band, its two rails, and the obstacles along it — drawn once per
	copy of the fundamental domain, so looking down the band shows the
	next lap already mirrored.

	**The two rails read differently, and that is the mechanic rather than
	decoration.**
	`docs/game/world.md` gives this space a
	legibility law — your handedness is readable *only relative to
	something you left behind* — and leaves open, explicitly, "how the
	player actually discovers their own current state cheaply enough that
	testing it isn't itself the boring part". This is an answer that costs
	one glance.

	**How it actually works, which is not what I first wrote.** A Möbius
	band has **one** boundary curve, not two: the glide identifies the
	line `y = +HALF_WIDTH` with `y = -HALF_WIDTH`, so what look like two
	rails are one rail of twice the band's own period, traversed in two
	passes. Painting it pale for the first period and dashed for the
	second is therefore a perfectly consistent decoration of a single
	curve — and it makes *which rail is beside me* a direct readout of
	**which of the two lifts the player is currently on**, which is
	exactly their handedness.

	The first version of this comment claimed the bright rail simply
	"moves to your other side" after a lap. That reading treats the edges
	as two independent objects, which the geometry does not; the top-down
	view where the rails visibly change places at the seam is the same
	fact stated correctly.

	Proposed here rather than settled in the design doc — it wants a
	playtest before it earns a place in `world-and-threads.md`.

	Colour is value only: κ = 0 is bone, slate and ash, and hue belongs to
	curvature alone.
