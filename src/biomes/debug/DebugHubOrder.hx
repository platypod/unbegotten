package biomes.debug;

/**
	The debug room's own view of
	`docs/game/world.md`'s numbering — which
	space is `1`, which is `2`, and what each is actually called.

	**Why this exists at all.** The registry knows biome *ids* (`conway`,
	`weft`, `sprawl`), which are implementation names and carry no order.
	The design numbers its spaces `0` to `9` along the curvature scale,
	and that ordering is the whole shape of the world — asked for directly
	(2026-08-16: "add numbers to the warp-gates"). Putting the mapping
	here rather than on `Biome` keeps design metadata out of the runtime
	contract: nothing in the game needs to know a biome's place in a
	reading order, and only this dev room does.

	**Unnumbered biomes are not an oversight.** `maze`, `tower`, `mobius`,
	`wind`, `exterior` and `twosided` predate the direction and have no
	place on the curvature scale. They keep their plain ids and sort after
	the numbered ones, which is also the honest signal that they are
	older work rather than part of the nine.

	Move this out of `biomes.debug` if anything but the debug room ever
	needs it — per `docs/rules/guidelines.md`, on the second use case, not the
	first.

	/**
		Design number and name per biome id, in the order
		`world-and-threads.md` lists them.

		Names drop the design's own leading "The". `graphics.LabelTexture`
		scales text to fit a fixed-width sign, so a long label renders in
		much smaller glyphs than a short one — "0. The Still Life" beside
		"wind" was a quarter the size and barely readable across the room.
		Dropping four characters from the longest name evens the row out
		and loses nothing: nobody will fail to recognise "5. Defect".

		`conway` is the Fold: the geodesic sphere kept the original biome's
		registry id when it was swapped in (see `game.GameLoop`), so the
		implementation name and the design name genuinely differ here.

		**The French name is on the sign too**, on a second line — the same
		set `docs/game/one-page.fr.svg` uses, kept here so the two cannot
		drift. They are not calques: the English names mostly carry a double
		meaning and the French ones have to carry one as well (`Le Repli` is
		the geometric fold *and* the pen you were kept safe in, `Le Motif` is
		the repeated pattern *and* the cause). `La Volte`, `Le Défaut`,
		`Le Ruban` and `La Prolifération` are still working titles — see the
		naming section of `docs/game/one-page.fr.md` before changing one.
