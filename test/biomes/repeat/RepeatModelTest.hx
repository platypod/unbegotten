/**
	Covers the two properties the whole space's mechanic rests on:
	**every tile is identical**, and **the ones that are not differ in
	exactly one place, in the direction that opens ground**.

	Both are the kind of claim that cannot be checked by looking. A city
	where tiles differed subtly everywhere would look exactly like one
	where they were identical, right up until a player tried to use the
	comparison mechanic and found it meaningless — and a divergence that
	*added* a building instead of removing one would be a difference you
	can only look at, which the design specifically rules out because
	noticing and reaching must be the same act.
