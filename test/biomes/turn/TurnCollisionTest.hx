/**
	Checks the one thing that makes this space a Möbius band rather than a
	long corridor: **going round once comes back mirrored, and going round
	twice does not**.

	That property cannot be seen. A wrap with the reflection accidentally
	dropped produces a cylinder, which walks identically, looks identical
	from any single vantage, and quietly teaches nothing — the space's
	entire lesson would be missing with no symptom. Everything else here
	(staying on the band, sliding past obstacles) is ordinary collision;
	the wrap is the part that needs proving.
