# Project log

Chronological record of decisions and major events for this project — the "why" behind `CLAUDE.md` / `docs/rules/guidelines.md`, and a history to look back on. New entries get appended at the bottom, oldest first. Each entry: date, short title, what happened/was decided, and why (briefly — full detail lives in `docs/rules/guidelines.md`, `README.md`, or a linked doc where relevant).

## 2026-07-15 — Tech stack: Haxe + Heaps

Project starts fresh with **Haxe + Heaps** as the language/engine for a small, browser-playable 3D game — compiles to WebGL for reliable desktop and mobile browser reach, with HashLink available for fast native dev/debugging.

## 2026-07-15 — Research pass

Researched general 3D game architecture (game loop patterns, ECS vs. OOP, scene graphs, state machines, event-driven design, data-driven content, object pooling) and Haxe/Heaps specifics (language conventions, null safety, `hxd.Res`, scene graph API, FBX/HMD pipeline, tooling, and prior art — notably Deepnight's `gameBase`, used for *Dead Cells*). Findings compiled into a discussion draft, with each point flagged as either a clear default or a genuine decision point.

## 2026-07-15 — Architecture & standards decisions

Went through the decision points one at a time. Final calls:

1. **Timestep:** fixed timestep (accumulator around `hxd.App.update`), decoupled from rendering, with interpolation — chosen to leave room for deterministic simulation (multiplayer/replays) without a later rewrite.
2. **Object model:** hybrid — `Entity` base class + composable data components (`Health`, `Movement`, `Inventory`...), no full ECS. Balances simplicity against giving AI-assisted edits a well-scoped place to land.
3. **Content data:** data-driven from the start — gameplay data (stats, items, levels) lives in external data (JSON via `hxd.Res`), not hardcoded in classes.
4. **Foundation:** roll a custom minimal `Process` tree + `Entity`/component pattern, rather than adopting Deepnight's `gameBase` — gameBase's pure-inheritance `Entity` doesn't fit the hybrid component model from decision 2.
5. **Null safety:** `Strict`, project-wide, from day one.
6. **Macros:** no new custom macros without explicit discussion; rely on Heaps' built-in macros otherwise.
7. **Testing:** `utest` (over `munit`), scoped to game logic — state machines, gameplay/interaction math, save/load, data parsing. Rendering/scene code excluded (not practically unit-testable).
8. **CI:** full — compile + headless `utest` run on every push, via a hand-written GitHub Actions workflow (no existing Haxe+Heaps template found).

## 2026-07-15 — Guideline documents produced

Turned the decisions above into two working documents:
- **`CLAUDE.md`** (project root) — concise, imperative rules for day-to-day AI-assisted work: the non-negotiables, no rationale, meant to be short enough to actually be followed.
- **`docs/rules/guidelines.md`** — full detail and rationale behind each rule in `CLAUDE.md`, organized by architecture / Haxe standards / Heaps specifics / tooling.

This log (`docs/archive/project-log.md`) started alongside them, to keep a reviewable history as the project continues.

## 2026-07-15 — Git workflow rule: commit everything, platypod-style messages

hooman asked for two things: every modification must be committed (for traceability/rollback), and commit messages should match the conventions actually used across the `platypod` GitHub org. Inspected `platypod/stack`, `platypod/mediarvester`, and `platypod/prompt-meter` commit history plus the org README, which explicitly calls for Conventional Commits.

Confirmed pattern: `type(scope): lowercase description`, types in practice being `feat`/`fix`/`refactor`/`doc` (singular — a deliberate org-wide deviation from the spec's `docs`)/`release`, scope sometimes a comma-separated list, optional body explaining *why* for non-trivial changes. Notably, `platypod/prompt-meter` (itself an AI-usage-metrics tool) already uses a `Co-Authored-By: Claude <model> <noreply@anthropic.com>` trailer on Claude-authored commits — adopted here too, since it's directly relevant to a vibe-coded project.

Added a "Git workflow" section to `CLAUDE.md` and a full "Git workflow & commit conventions" section to `docs/rules/guidelines.md`, with the actual commit examples pulled from the org as reference.

## 2026-07-15 — Pre-commit hooks & web deployment

Two more topics: local pre-commit enforcement, and how the game reaches players on prod.

**Pre-commit:** confirmed no repo in the platypod org uses a pre-commit framework (`pre-commit`/`husky`/`lefthook`) — every repo drives quality gates through a self-documented `Makefile` (targets like `lint`, `test`, `build`, called identically by CI). Followed suit: a `Makefile` with `fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test`/`build` targets, plus a versioned `.githooks/pre-commit` (wired via `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`, not the unversioned `.git/hooks/`) that runs `make fmt lint check test` and blocks the commit on failure. Documented in `docs/rules/guidelines.md` §5.

**Deployment:** confirmed the plan is a browser-playable web build, reachable from both desktop and phone, deployed onto platypod's prod stack (Kubernetes/Helmfile, `platypod.ovh`). Findings and decisions:
- Heaps compiles straight to JS/WebGL — no separate engine/wrapper needed for the web build. WebGL (not WebGPU) is the right call for mobile reach: WebGPU is still fragmented across mobile browsers, while WebGL2 is ubiquitous.
- **Mobile controls: deferred.** 3D games assume mouse-look + WASD, which don't exist on a touchscreen; decided to build desktop/mouse-keyboard first and treat touch controls as a later, dedicated design pass rather than guessing at a control scheme before there's a game to control. Logged in `docs/rules/guidelines.md` §1.8.
- **Access control: behind Authelia SSO**, matching every other service in platypod's `games` module (`pokeclicker`, `rommapp`) rather than a public exception.
- **Container:** inspected `platypod/pokeclicker`'s deployment (Node.js wrapper) and the `games` Helm module's `Deployment`/`Service`/`IngressRoute` templates as reference. Our case is simpler — Heaps' web output is static files, so the shipped container is a static file server (nginx/Caddy) with no language runtime, built via a multi-stage Dockerfile.
- **Release build:** matches `mediarvester`/`prompt-meter` — a git tag push triggers GitHub Actions to build a multi-arch image (buildx, `linux/amd64`+`linux/arm64`) and push it to `ghcr.io/platypod/unbegotten`. No cluster credentials touch GitHub at this step.
- **Deploying to prod on release: deliberately left open.** hooman doesn't want any cluster credential stored in GitHub. Three options were laid out — manual `make deploy MODULE=games ENV=prd` (matches the org today, zero new infra, zero GitHub-side credentials), adopting GitOps (Flux CD pulling new tags from GHCR from inside the cluster — genuinely credential-free on the GitHub side, but real infrastructure work spanning the `stack`/`infra` repos), or a small self-hosted webhook receiver (narrower secret than a kubeconfig, but custom code to maintain). Decision deferred — see `README.md` "Deployment" section for the write-up, to be resolved and logged here later.

## 2026-07-15 — Project scaffold bootstrapped, HashLink/ARM caveat found

First real code: `src/`, `test/`, `build.hxml`, `test.hxml`, `Makefile`, `.githooks/pre-commit` (wired via `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`), `checkstyle.json`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and `index.html`. `make fmt`/`fmt-check`/`lint`/`check`/`test`/`build` all verified working; `Main.hx` boots a Heaps app (fixed-timestep accumulator per `CLAUDE.md`, no gameplay yet) and was confirmed rendering (WebGL context created, canvas fills the window, clears to the configured background color) in a browser.

Also committed `old/` (the abandoned TS+Babylon prototype) to git — it had never actually been committed, just sitting on disk. Its maze-generation and sphere-math logic is genuinely reusable reference for the eventual Haxe port, so it's kept rather than deleted.

Three findings that changed the plan from what `docs/rules/guidelines.md` originally described:

1. **HashLink's JIT VM isn't available at all on Apple Silicon via Homebrew** — only HashLink/C (compile-to-C-then-native) is supported on ARM ([hashlink#557](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hashlink/issues/557)). The "fast `hl.hxml` dev loop" §6.1 describes doesn't work as written on this machine. For now there's a single `build.hxml` targeting JS, used for both the compile-check and the production build; `test.hxml` also targets JS and tests run via `node`. Revisit if HL/C wiring or a non-ARM dev box makes the split worth adding. Corrected in `docs/rules/guidelines.md` §6.1.
2. **`checkstyle`'s default ruleset (generated via `--default-config`) contradicts `CLAUDE.md`'s own explicit-type-annotation rule** — it warns on explicit `Void` returns and pushes to omit type hints on locals. Tuned two checks to match (`Return.enforceReturnType: true`, `VarTypeHint` disabled), and turned off `EmptyLines`' require-blank-line-after-class rule since `haxe-formatter` strips that blank line by default and the two tools disagreeing would break `make fmt` → `make lint` every time. Logged in `docs/rules/guidelines.md` §5.3.
3. **`index.html` needs to live next to `game.js`** — Heaps' HTML5 target loads a canvas by id (`#webgl`) and the built JS is a sibling `<script src="game.js">`, but `haxe build.hxml` only emits into `bin/`. `make build` now copies `index.html` into `bin/` after compiling, so `bin/` is a complete, self-contained static web root — matching what §6.2's container step expects to copy into `nginx`/`caddy`.

No gameplay code yet — next slice is porting `old/`'s maze generation and sphere math to Haxe with `utest` coverage, per the "Scaffold + port maze/sphere math" discussion.

## 2026-07-15 — Sphere math and maze generation ported to Haxe

`src/game/SphereMath.hx` and `src/maze/Maze.hx` port `old/src/scene/sphereMath.ts` and `old/src/maze/mazeGenerator.ts` respectively — both are pure, engine-agnostic algorithms, so they carried over unchanged. `test/SphereMathTest.hx` and `test/MazeTest.hx` mirror the old vitest suites case for case (25 + 3 = 28 assertions passing). Still no rendering — this is grid/geometry logic only, nothing on screen yet.

**Maze design: discussed and kept as-is.** Before porting, walked through the three real open questions (lat/long grid + merged poles vs. a pole-safe cube-sphere/geodesic grid; perfect maze vs. adding loops; 16×32 resolution) and decided to keep all three unchanged from the prototype — each is cheap to revisit later once there's a playable build to judge against, and the lat/long+merged-pole approach is already a solved, tested problem. Revisit if pole distortion or pacing turns out to matter once the maze is actually walkable.

Two implementation notes:
- **Test RNG isn't old/'s mulberry32.** `MazeNode`'s tests need a deterministic seeded PRNG for the spanning-tree checks, same as the original. mulberry32 needs 32-bit-wraparound multiply (`Math.imul` in JS), which isn't portable across Haxe targets without target-specific code; since this is test-only plumbing (not shipped gameplay RNG) and doesn't need to match the original's exact sequence, `test/MazeTest.hx` uses a small xorshift32 instead (needs only bitwise ops, which Haxe guarantees as 32-bit on every target).
- **Haxe enum values need `Type.enumEq`, not `==`, for structural comparison.** `Array.contains`/`indexOf` use `==`, which for parameterized enum constructors (`RingNode(row, col)`) is reference equality, not structural — caught by `testColumnsWrapAround` failing until switched to `Lambda.exists(..., (a, b) -> Type.enumEq(a, b))`.

**checkstyle ruleset tuning, round 2** (see `docs/rules/guidelines.md` §5.3 for the full list): `MemberName` was applying lowerCamelCase to enum constructors (Haxe convention is UpperCamelCase there, now codified in `CLAUDE.md`); `AvoidTernaryOperator` disabled (fights idiomatic, already-used style); `OperatorWhitespace.oldFunctionTypePolicy` set to `none` to match `haxe-formatter`'s tight `Void->Float` output (a same-token, different-context sibling of the `arrowFunctionPolicy` that already worked for real lambdas). `TypeDocComment`/`FieldDocComment`'s hardcoded 3-line-minimum isn't configurable — left as accepted Info-level noise for genuinely one-line-worthy docs, same treatment as `MagicNumber` on test literals.

## 2026-07-15 — First pixels: camera, maze mesh, player movement

Three requested slices landed in one pass — the first time anything actually renders. All verified in-browser (screenshots + real keyboard events), not just compiled/tested.

**Camera** (`entities/Player.hx`): holds spherical position (theta, phi) and a facing angle, applies that state to an `h3d.Camera` each fixed step — "up" points toward the sphere's center (matches the "raise your head, see the far side" mechanic), forward is `thetaTangentAt` rotated by `facing`. Standalone rather than an `Entity` subclass — no Process/Entity foundation exists yet, and one use case isn't reason enough to build it (`docs/rules/guidelines.md` §1.3). `maze/MazeGeometry.hx` centralizes the grid→sphere mapping (radius, theta/phi per row/col) so both the camera and the mesh use the same one.

**Maze mesh** (`maze/MazeMesh.hx`): a floor quad per ring cell, and a wall wherever `Maze.isOpen` is false — walls are a simplified approximation (a perpendicular quad at the midpoint between two blocked cells, not exact cell-boundary geometry), good enough to read clearly, uniform across row/column/pole adjacency without per-edge-type math. Hit and fixed one real bug during this: per-vertex colors attached to a single `h3d.prim.Polygon` never showed up, because Heaps' default material shader doesn't read a vertex-color stream on its own — split into two meshes (floor, walls), each with a uniform `material.color`, which is what actually worked (same approach the earlier debug wireframe already used). Both meshes are unlit (`enableLights = false`, no scene lights exist yet) and double-sided (`culling = None`).

**Player movement** (`Player.moveForward`/`turn`, wired into `Main.fixedUpdate` via `hxd.Key.isDown` for WASD/arrows): turning is just `facing += delta`; forward movement rotates the *position* toward `forward` within the great circle they define — `pos*cos(angle) + forward*radius*sin(angle)`, angle = distance/radius. First attempt used the simpler "move in the tangent plane, then re-normalize onto the sphere" trick; `test/PlayerTest.hx` caught that this is only a first-order approximation (drifts from the true arc length at larger step sizes, e.g. ~3% error at a 17° step) — the closed-form rotation above is exact for any distance and no more code, so it replaced the approximation rather than just loosening the test's tolerance.

**Tool note, not a code issue:** the Browser pane's `computer{action:"key"}` didn't register with the running game (Heaps' HTML5 target listens for `keydown`/`keyup` on the canvas element specifically, not `window`/`document`); dispatching a real `KeyboardEvent` at the canvas via `javascript_tool` worked and confirmed both turning and movement visually. Worth remembering for testing this project in-browser going forward.

Not done: no collision (walking through walls is currently possible — movement only reads the maze grid indirectly, through where the mesh happens to be, not through it), no lighting, no textures/materials beyond flat color, poles have no floor patch (small gap at the very tip of each pole). All reasonable next slices, not blockers for what was asked this round.

## 2026-07-15 — Camera pitch (and two real bugs it exposed)

hooman reported, after the previous session: can't see the far side of the sphere at all, and walls read as tiny/thin. The second was a real tuning miss — `WALL_HEIGHT` (4) against a ~10-unit gap between cells; bumped to 12 (see `MazeMesh`). The first was a missing feature, not a tuning issue: `Player` had no pitch — the camera could only ever look horizontally along the local tangent plane, which is mathematically incapable of showing the far side (that requires tilting toward "up", through the center). Added `Player.pitch` (clamped to `MAX_PITCH`, just under pi/2 to dodge an exact-parallel degenerate lookAt) and `Player.lookUp`, wired to PGUP/PGDOWN in `Main.fixedUpdate` as a keyboard-only placeholder (mouse-look is a likely follow-up once there's a reason to add it).

Landing the actual pitch tilt took three iterations, each one a real bug caught by either a failing test or a screenshot that didn't match what the math said it should show — worth recording in detail since the failure modes are non-obvious and likely to recur if this code gets touched again:

1. **Camera.up must tilt with the view, not stay fixed.** First attempt kept `camera.up` at the fixed sphere-relative "up" (toward center) while only tilting the view direction toward it. As pitch increases, the view direction drifts toward *parallel* with that fixed up — degenerate for a lookAt camera (the internal "right" vector, forward × up, shrinks toward zero), collapsing the effective horizontal FOV toward a sliver well before the pitch clamp. Caught by comparing rendered screenshots at a few pitch values: 0 and 0.3 looked nearly identical (should differ a lot), and 0.8/1.5 both rendered as a flat, undifferentiated fill — not the gradual widening-view a correct pitch should produce. Fix: rotate `up` by the same angle around the same axis as `forward` (`SphereMath.rotateAroundAxis(frame.up, right, pitch)`), which stays perpendicular to the view direction at any pitch by construction. `test/PlayerTest.hx`'s `testApplyToCameraKeepsUpPerpendicularToViewAtAnyPitch` guards against this regressing.
2. **Zero eye height.** Even after fixing (1), pitching still showed a flat fill at every pitch above ~0 — because `camera.pos` sits exactly on the floor mesh (same radius as the floor quads themselves). Looking up from a position embedded in the floor grazes along/through that same floor rather than clearing it. Added `Player.EYE_HEIGHT` (6, below `WALL_HEIGHT` so walls still read as walls above eye level) — camera position is now `floorPos + up * EYE_HEIGHT`. Note the sign: "up" here means toward the sphere's center, so the eye ends up at a *smaller* radius than the floor, not larger (`test/PlayerTest.hx`'s `testApplyToCameraOffsetsEyeHeightAboveTheFloor` — first draft of this test had the sign backwards too, a good reminder that "up" is inverted from ordinary planet-surface intuition throughout this codebase).
3. **A Heaps-specific verification gotcha, not a code bug:** holding a key across a real-time `wait` in the browser preview barely moved the pitch, because `hxd.Timer` clamps `dt` to a single frame's worth whenever the real elapsed time between frames exceeds `maxDeltaTime` (an anti-spiral-of-death safeguard) — under this environment's throttled/backgrounded rendering, wall-clock waits don't translate to proportional simulation time. Worked around by constructing `Player` with a known starting pitch directly for verification screenshots, rather than trying to simulate a held key over wall-clock time.

Once (1) and (2) were both fixed, pitching up revealed a whole arc of distinct wall segments curving across the frame — the actual "raise your head, see across the sphere" effect, confirmed visually for the first time this session.

## 2026-07-16 — Wall rendering: a real shader bug, and a real proportions bug

hooman reported walls looking wrong two ways after the pitch session: a dark-to-tan gradient with roughly half of every wall's face rendering pitch black (screenshotted from two different angles, including one showing the effect across an entire radial cluster of walls near a pole), and separately — walls looking oversized and oddly (triangular/wedge) shaped.

**The gradient/half-dark issue was a real bug**, not fog or intentional shading: `MazeMesh`'s meshes relied on `material.color` + `mainPass.enableLights = false` to render flat and unlit, matching what seemed to work for the earlier debug wireframe. But `enableLights = false` only skips the *scene light* contribution — the PBR technique's other lighting/falloff terms still run and still depend on the surface normal, which the `h3d.prim.Polygon` primitive never had set (no `normals` array was ever assigned). First attempted fix: compute and assign real per-face flat normals — compiled fine, but didn't change the rendered result at all, so the normal-dependent-term theory was only half right. Cross-checked against `h3d.scene.Graphics` (used successfully for the earlier debug wireframe): it sets `material.shadows = false` *and* adds an explicit `h3d.shader.FixedColor` pass that overwrites the fragment output directly, rather than trusting `enableLights=false` to fully disable PBR shading. Switched `MazeMesh` to the same `FixedColor` shader — confirmed in-browser to produce genuinely flat, gradient-free color with no dark half. In hindsight, the earlier "triangular wedge" shape hooman reported was very likely the same bug — parts of an ordinary rectangular wall rendering pitch black and blending into the black background, producing a false wedge-shaped silhouette rather than an actual geometry defect.

**The "too big" complaint was a real proportions bug**, confirmed by the numbers rather than just eyeballing it: cells are ~10 units apart at `MazeGeometry.RADIUS=50`, so a wall directly across a cell sits only ~5 units from a player standing at the cell center. At the 70-degree vertical FOV (`Main.CAMERA_FOV_Y`), a wall taller than ~7 units already subtends the *entire* frame from that distance — `WALL_HEIGHT=12` (set last session in response to "walls look tiny") subtends ~100 degrees, overfilling the 70-degree FOV outright, which is exactly what "too big" was. Reduced to 5 (~53 degrees from one cell away — present but not dominant). The original "too tiny" complaint that motivated raising it to 12 was probably itself a symptom of the eye-height/camera-up bugs fixed earlier the same session, not a real proportions problem with the original height=4 — worth remembering before re-tuning this value again: check the camera math is sound *before* trusting a visual size judgment against it.

## 2026-07-16 — Walls rebuilt from shared corners, not independent centers

Still not right after the shading/height fixes above: hooman reported walls "not seamlessly connecting to one another... not fit for a sphere." Real design gap, not a rendering bug this time — `MazeMesh`'s wall builder computed each wall independently from the straight-line distance between the *centers* of the two cells it separated (midpoint, a locally-built "across"/"up" frame, width = center-to-center distance). Nothing tied one wall's geometry to its neighbors', or to the floor cells it was supposed to sit against — on a curved sphere that's visibly seamed and disconnected rather than a continuous structure, exactly as reported.

Rebuilt wall generation around the floor cells' own corner points instead of independent per-edge midpoints: every ring cell already has four corners (`MazeMesh.cornersOf`, matching the same lat/long boundaries `addFloor` uses), and a wall on any of a cell's four sides now literally reuses that cell's corner points as its base, extruding each corner upward along *that corner's own* local "up" (radial) direction rather than a single shared frame per wall. Two adjacent cells always compute identical points for the edge between them (verified algebraically and now by `test/MazeMeshTest.hx` — column-adjacency, row-adjacency, and column wraparound all check that neighboring cells' `cornersOf` calls agree on their shared edge, 62 assertions total), and since both cells' walls at that corner extrude the *same point* through the *same function*, their top edges coincide too. That's what makes everything connect: floor-to-wall (shared base corners) and wall-to-wall (shared corners between adjacent closed edges).

Also refactored `maybeAddWall`'s parameter list (checkstyle flagged 8 params, a real smell) into a small `WallBuilder` class bundling the accumulating vertex/index buffers and the seen-edges set — `MazeGeometry.positionOf`/`anglesOf` became dead code in the process (nothing needs a cell's *center* for wall-building anymore) and were removed rather than left unused.

Confirmed in-browser: walls now visibly meet at their corners, forming one continuous connected structure instead of independent floating segments.

## 2026-07-16 — Player spun near the poles: a coordinate-singularity bug

hooman reported the player spinning "at mach-speed like a spinner" walking through a pole, and correctly guessed the cause: proximity to a pole was affecting movement. The actual mechanism: `Player` stored position as spherical coordinates (theta, phi), and phi is singular at the poles — circles of latitude shrink to zero circumference there, so a tiny physical step near a pole corresponds to a huge change in phi even though the real 3D position barely moved. `facing` was a scalar angle measured against a tangent basis (`thetaTangentAt(theta, phi)`) reconstructed fresh from phi on every `moveForward`/`applyToCamera` call — so that phi instability showed up directly as the *view* spinning, not just a numeric wobble.

Fixed by removing theta/phi from `Player`'s state entirely. It now stores `pos` and `forward` as plain 3D vectors, updated by direct rotation (`SphereMath.rotateAroundAxis`) rather than ever being reconstructed from a (theta, phi) parameterization — `moveForward` rotates `pos` and `forward` together, by the same angle around the same axis, exactly the parallel-transport formula for walking a geodesic; `turn` rotates `forward` around the local "up" directly. Neither has a coordinate singularity anywhere on the sphere, poles included, because there's no phi computation involved in maintaining orientation at all. `theta`/`phi` still exist as spawn-time convenience — `Player.spawnAt(theta, phi, facing, radius)` does the one-time conversion to `pos`/`forward` and is used exactly once, at `Main.init`.

`test/PlayerTest.hx` needed a full rewrite for the new vector-based API (asserting on `pos`/`forward` directly rather than `.theta`/`.phi` fields), and gained a test aimed squarely at the reported bug: spawn just short of the north pole, face straight at it, walk a distance that crosses right through theta=0, and assert that `forward` rotated by *exactly* the arc angle traveled (`cos(angle) == oldForward.dot(newForward)`) — no more, no less, regardless of the pole. Passed on the first try once the vector-based rewrite was in place; 71 assertions across `PlayerTest` now.

## 2026-07-16 — Release build: Dockerfile + tag-triggered GitHub Actions

First deployment piece: `Dockerfile` and `.github/workflows/build.yml`, matching `mediarvester`/`prompt-meter`'s pattern exactly rather than inventing a new one — `docker/setup-qemu-action` + `docker/setup-buildx-action` + `docker/build-push-action`, triggered on any tag push, building `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64` and pushing to `ghcr.io/platypod/unbegotten:<tag>` + `:latest`. No cluster credentials touch GitHub in this flow.

`Dockerfile` is a two-stage build: `haxe:4.3.7-alpine` (confirmed via Docker Hub's API to actually exist at that exact tag before committing to it — `haxe:4.3.7-alpine3.24`/`haxe:4.3.7-alpine` both do) runs `haxelib install heaps` and `haxe build.hxml`, matching `make build`'s output exactly; `nginx:alpine` then serves the resulting `bin/` with no language runtime in the shipped image. `haxelib install` needed no `haxelib setup` step first — confirmed by actually running `docker run haxe:4.3.7-alpine haxelib install heaps` locally rather than assuming. Built the full image locally afterward (`docker build` + `docker run` + loaded it in-browser) before writing anything into CI — confirmed it renders identically to the local dev build, walls connected, no console errors.

**One manual step ahead, flagged per hooman's request rather than acted on now:** the first tag push will create the `unbegotten` GHCR package as **private** (GitHub's default for new packages, and there's no REST API to change visibility — a platform limitation, not a platypod choice). After that first push, someone needs to manually set it public once via `github.com/orgs/platypod/packages` → `unbegotten` → Package settings → Danger Zone → Change visibility → Public. Same one-time step `mediarvester`'s README documents; copied the same note into `unbegotten`'s README rather than let this be tribal knowledge again.

Next: a service in `stack`'s `games` module to actually deploy the image to prod (`Deployment` + `Service` + `IngressRoute`, same shape as `pokeclicker`/`rommapp`) — the prod-deploy-automation question itself (manual vs. Flux vs. webhook) stays deliberately deferred, per README's "Prod deploy" section.

## 2026-07-16 — Player/wall collision

Until now `Player.moveForward` always succeeded — you could walk straight through a closed wall. Added collision without teaching `Player` about `Maze` at all: a new `game.Collision.tryMoveForward(player, distance, radius, maze)` snapshots `pos`/`forward`, calls the existing (now unmodified) `Player.moveForward`, checks whether that step crossed into a different maze node, and rolls the move back if the edge it crossed is closed. `Player` stays exactly as maze-agnostic as its class doc already claimed.

The node-membership check itself is the interesting new piece: `Maze.nodeAt(theta, phi)` — the inverse of the cell layout `MazeMesh.cornersOf`/`neighborsOf` already assume — takes plain spherical coordinates rather than a 3D point (keeping `Maze` engine-agnostic, per its class doc) and snaps to a `PoleNode` within half a row's width of a pole regardless of phi, mirroring `neighborsOf`'s merged-pole topology. That last part matters for the same reason `Player`'s own orientation fix mattered last session: a column index computed right at a pole is meaningless (circumference shrinks to zero there), so without the snap, collision would have reintroduced a pole-adjacent instability right next to the one already fixed. `SphereMath` gained the two small inverse functions (`thetaOf`/`phiOf`) `nodeAt` needed a caller to convert a `pos` vector into.

This is a per-tick discrete check (same-node-or-open-edge), not a swept intersection against wall geometry — deliberately: at `Main.WALK_SPEED` versus the grid's cell size, a step can't jump clean over an intervening node in one tick, so there's nothing a continuous sweep would catch that the discrete node transition doesn't. Diagonal steps that skip past a grid corner into a non-adjacent node are blocked too, for free — `Maze.isOpen` only ever has entries for nodes that are actual grid neighbors, so a non-adjacent pair reads as closed.

Tested against real generated mazes (`Maze.generate` with a seeded RNG, same pattern `MazeTest.hx` already used) rather than a hand-built edge map, so the tests exercise the same `nodeAt`/`isOpen` path the game does instead of duplicating `Maze`'s internal edge-key format — `CollisionTest.hx` finds an actual open and an actual closed edge via the public `allNodes`/`neighborsOf`/`isOpen` API, then asserts a move landing exactly on the open neighbor's center succeeds and one crossing the closed edge is rejected with position unchanged.

Verified interactively too, and in a way worth remembering for next time: the browser preview tab reports `document.hidden = true` (the rAF-throttling quirk noted a few sessions back), so holding "w" across a real-time `wait` barely moved the player at all — not a collision bug, the render loop itself barely ticks while the tab is treated as backgrounded. Worked around by temporarily exposing `player`/`maze`/`Collision`/`Maze` on `window` from `Main.init` and calling `Collision.tryMoveForward` directly from the browser console instead of going through key events and wall-clock time — several open steps forward, then a hard stop at a wall, in two different directions, with position exactly frozen once blocked. Reverted the exposure before committing.

## 2026-07-16 — Walls textured: a stone-block material, and another preview-harness quirk

Replaced the walls' flat `FixedColor` tan with an actual low-poly-style stone-block texture (`res/textures/wall_stone.png`) — a procedurally generated, seamlessly-tiling running-bond block grid (flat per-block color from a small gray-brown palette, darker mortar lines; no photographic detail, matching the flat-shaded aesthetic the rest of the maze already has). First real asset in the project, so it's also the first use of `hxd.Res`: added `-D resourcesPath=res` to both `build.hxml` and `test.hxml` (needed even for tests — `hxd.Res`'s typed accessors are generated by a `@:build` macro that runs at compile time regardless of whether the accessed field is ever called at runtime, and `MazeMeshTest` transitively compiles `MazeMesh`), `hxd.Res.initEmbed()` in `Main.init` (base64-embeds the texture straight into `game.js` — simpler than serving a separate `res/` folder for one small file, and confirmed to work fine on the `-js` target), and `COPY res/ ./res/` in the Dockerfile's build stage.

Kept walls unlit rather than switching to a normal lit+textured material — reusing a normal material here would have reintroduced the exact PBR shading bug from a few sessions back (`enableLights=false` alone doesn't fully bypass lighting/falloff terms without per-vertex normals). `h3d.shader.Texture` (Heaps' built-in) turned out not to fit either — it multiplies into `pixelColor` for use *within* the lit pipeline rather than replacing it. Wrote a small `game/shader/UnlitTexture.hx` instead: same shape as `h3d.shader.FixedColor` (writes `output.color` directly, sidestepping PBR entirely) but samples a texture at the fragment's UV instead of outputting one flat color. `MazeMesh`'s `WallBuilder` gained a `uvs` array parallel to `points`, computed per wall quad from the chord length between its two base corners divided by a new `WALL_TEXTURE_TILE_SIZE` (5, matching `WALL_HEIGHT` so tiles read roughly square) — so the texture repeats across a wall's length rather than one tile stretching to fit, keeping texel density consistent across differently-sized walls. The floor keeps `FixedColor` unchanged; only walls got the treatment.

**Verification hit a second, unrelated preview-harness quirk worth recording** (same root cause as the rAF one above — `document.hidden = true` in this environment): the rendered canvas's actual pixel buffer was stuck at 32x32 (and CSS size 16x16), regardless of camera position, because Heaps sets the canvas size from `window.innerWidth/innerHeight` at startup and only revisits it on a real `resize` event — and whatever the hidden-document state reported at that first read stuck permanently. Confirmed this is purely an artifact of the preview harness, not a game bug: manually setting `canvas.style.width/height` back to 100% and dispatching a synthetic `resize` event fixed it completely and instantly, and a manual `engine.render(s3d)` call (also needed since the render loop itself barely ticks while hidden) then showed the maze at full 2048x1280 resolution with the stone texture tiling cleanly across every wall, connecting seamlessly around corners, no gradient or lighting artifacts. Not expected to affect real players (a normal foregrounded tab reports a real size from the start), so left uninvestigated further as a real fix — flagged rather than chased, per the general rule of not fixing things beyond what was asked.

## 2026-07-16 — Mouse-look, ZQSD, a SPACE view-tilt, thicker walls, and wall-sliding

Four changes in one session, three commits (input, wall geometry, collision), landed in that order.

**Input overhaul.** PGUP/PGDOWN for pitch is gone, replaced by mouse-look: `hxd.Window.getInstance().mouseMode = Relative(onMouseMove, true)` in `Main.init`, which hides the cursor and reports movement deltas instead of a position — engages automatically on the player's first click on the canvas per `hxd.Window`'s own doc, nothing else to wire up. Movement/turning keys became Z/Q/S/D plus the arrows (dropping WASD) — `hxd.Key.Z`/`Q`/`S`/`D` are plain keycodes (81/90/83/68) taken straight from the browser's legacy `KeyboardEvent.keyCode`, hardcoded for AZERTY specifically.
(Correction, 2026-07-18: that keyCode is *layout-labeled*, not physical-position-based — it broke on QWERTY. See the 2026-07-18 entry below for the actual fix.)

SPACE took over "look up," keeping PGUP's continuous hold-to-tilt behavior, but added a twist: hold it a full second *while still moving* and it auto-releases, snapping `pitch` back to 0 so walking blind doesn't linger — checked once at that 1-second mark (not re-armed until SPACE is released and pressed again), and skipped entirely if the player is standing still, so a stationary player can hold the far-side view as long as they like. `Main.isMoveKeyDown()` is what "moving" means here — whether a movement key is currently held, independent of whether `Collision` actually let the last step through.

**Walls gained real thickness.** They were zero-thickness planes; `WallBuilder.maybeAdd` now extrudes each segment into its own front/back/top box straddling the boundary line (new `MazeMesh.WALL_THICKNESS`), and `WALL_HEIGHT` bumped 5→6 — both scaled up together on purpose to preserve the FOV-subtense ratio tuned a few sessions back (~53deg from one cell away, unchanged). `MazeGeometry.RADIUS` bumped 50→58 so corridors gain more room than the added thickness eats into them net of both changes — a single-parameter fix since corridor width scales directly with `RADIUS` at fixed `Maze.ROWS`/`COLS` resolution, without touching maze topology at all.

Thickening exposed a real gap, reported directly with screenshots after visual review: hollow open ends wherever a wall segment's independently-offset box doesn't line up with whatever's next to it — most visible at dead-end stubs (open space beyond, nothing to occlude the hollow interior), but also at angled junctions where two segments' offset planes don't fully cover each other. Rather than mitering every junction (computing each shared vertex from the intersection of both segments' offset planes — real geometry work for a cosmetic gain), `WallBuilder` now drops a small square corner post (`ensurePost`) at every point a wall segment ends, deduplicated by exact coordinate match (shared corners are always bit-for-bit identical, per the same guarantee `MazeMeshTest` already checks), sized to the wall's own thickness. A post fully seals whatever's sitting on it regardless of how many segments converge or at what angle — confirmed in-browser across several vantage points post-fix, no visible gaps.

**Collision slides instead of stopping dead.** `Collision.tryMoveForward` used to just cancel a blocked step outright, full stop regardless of approach angle. It now retries a blocked step as a slide: project the attempted `forward` onto the wall's tangent direction (dropping the into-the-wall component) and move along *that* instead — approaching square-on leaves ~nothing to project, a shallow angle keeps most of it, the same physics any FPS wall-slide uses. `Player` gained `moveAlong(direction, distance, radius)` — `moveForward`'s math minus the `forward`-rotation line — so a slide redirects position without touching where the player's looking.

Getting the wall's tangent direction right took a wrong turn worth recording: the first attempt evaluated `thetaTangentAt`/`phiTangentAt` at the player's own (theta, phi) — reasonable-looking, and it broke exactly one test, `testMoveAcrossAClosedEdgeIsBlockedAndLeavesPositionUnchanged`, the moment the closed edge under the test's seed happened to be pole-adjacent. Phi is meaningless exactly at a pole (the same singularity `Player`'s own vector-based orientation fix exists to avoid — see the "coordinate-singularity" entry above), so `phiTangentAt` there returned an essentially arbitrary direction unrelated to the actual wall, and a "square-on" approach picked up a spurious nonzero slide. Fixed by deriving the tangent from the *blocked node's* nominal center as a plain 3D point instead (`Maze.centerOf`, new — also let `CollisionTest`'s own duplicate of the same logic get deleted in favor of it): `oldPos`'s radial direction crossed with the direction toward that center, never touching theta/phi at the player's current position at all. A second, smaller wrinkle: a truly square hit's projected slide distance isn't held to exact-zero the way pure trig identities are (both vectors come from their own chain of cross products) — a `1e-9` floor on the slide distance before applying it squashes that floating-point noise rather than let it jitter the player on an exactly perpendicular hit.

Verified via three new tests (`Player.moveAlong`'s arc-length/no-rotation invariants, `Collision`'s oblique-hit slide) and interactively: a diagonal approach into a maze corridor showed full steps in open space, a reduced/redirected step as the wall was engaged at an angle, then a hard stop once boxed fully into a corner — exactly the intended feel.

## 2026-07-16 — Three more, reported after actually playing with the above

hooman came back with three concrete problems after using the new mouse-look/ZQSD/thicker-walls/sliding session: the wall texture still looked "shakey," gliding "hardly works... stops working after a really short time," and the collision hitbox didn't match the new wall thickness. All three turned out to be real, distinct bugs, not the same thing wearing three hats.

**Gliding breaking down was `Player.moveAlong` leaving `forward` untouched.** Traced directly: a 300-tick simulated hold-into-a-wall showed `pos.normalized().dot(forward)` drifting to -0.28 within ~20 ticks — `forward` had drifted out of the tangent plane, since nothing ever re-aligned it as the tangent plane itself rotated out from under a frozen `forward` during repeated slides. Fixed by parallel-transporting `forward` by the same rotation as `pos` in `moveAlong` (exactly what `moveForward` already does for its own direction) — the correct minimal adjustment on a curved surface, not a re-orientation toward the wall. A second copy of the same bug was hiding in `Collision.slideAlong`'s own rollback path: it reverted `pos` but not `forward` when the slide itself turned out to be blocked too, now that `moveAlong` touches both. After the fix, the same 300-tick simulation held `dot(forward)` at machine epsilon throughout, and total slide distance before a legitimate dead-end nearly tripled (5.24 -> 14.91 units).

**The shaky texture was real overlapping geometry, not a rendering bug.** Each wall segment was its own box, offset independently along its own length direction from the shared edge it sat on — two segments meeting at a corner computed *different* offset points for what was nominally the same corner, and the corner-post patch from the previous session only moved the overlap to a different piece of geometry rather than removing it. Rebuilt walls per cell instead of per edge: each cell now has both its outer corners (`cornersOf`, the true grid boundary, unchanged) and new inner corners (`innerCornersOf`, inset toward the cell's own center by `MazeGeometry.WALL_THICKNESS` along theta and phi independently, phi corrected for the sphere's curvature). A closed side draws one piece per cell, outer-to-inner, on that cell's own territory only — within a cell, adjacent sides share the same corners and meet edge-to-edge; between cells, both sides stop exactly at the shared outer boundary. Each piece dropped from 3 quads (front/back/top) to 4 (inner face/top/two end caps) and the corner-post mechanism went away entirely — end caps seal a piece regardless of what's next to it, without needing to know anything about neighboring pieces.

**The hitbox mismatch was `Collision` never having learned about wall thickness at all.** It still blocked exactly at `Maze.nodeAt`'s cell-to-cell midpoint — the old zero-thickness boundary, which the wall's actual rendered face sits `WALL_THICKNESS` short of now. Added `Maze.wallZoneNeighbor`: whether a position has crossed into the strip between a cell's own inner and outer boundary on a closed side, without necessarily having left the node `nodeAt` still reports. `Collision.blockingNode` checks this first, falling back to the old cross-node check only for a step large enough to skip clean over it (doesn't happen at `Main.WALK_SPEED` in practice). Verified precisely: walking a player into a wall now stops them exactly 1.500 units short of the old zero-thickness boundary (bit-for-bit `WALL_THICKNESS`) and 0.000 units short of the wall's actual rendered face. `wallZoneNeighbor` takes `radius` as an explicit parameter rather than reading `MazeGeometry.RADIUS` directly, matching every other function in the codebase that depends on which physical sphere is in play — moved `WALL_THICKNESS` itself into `MazeGeometry` alongside `RADIUS` for the same reason, since it's now a shared physical-geometry constant `MazeMesh` and `Collision` both need, not a rendering-only one.

Doesn't attempt a per-neighbor wall-zone for the merged pole cap (it isn't subdivided by column, so the concept doesn't directly apply there) — a player approaching a wall right at the pole boundary still stops at the old zero-thickness line rather than the wall's actual face. A known, small gap in an already-distorted corner of the grid, left alone rather than solved preemptively.

## 2026-07-16 — Q/D strafe instead of turning

Q and D used to just duplicate the arrow keys (turn left/right) — asked to make them strafe instead, moving sideways without reorienting, the same relationship forward/backward already has to facing. LEFT/RIGHT keep turning.

`Collision.tryMoveForward` became a thin wrapper over a new, general `Collision.tryMove(player, direction, distance, radius, maze)` — the wall-zone/slide logic never actually cared whether the direction being moved along was `player.forward`, so strafing needed the same implementation, not a duplicate of it. `slideAlong`'s `forward` parameter is renamed `attemptedDirection` to match, since it was already just "whichever direction the blocked step was attempted along."

`Player.rightVector()` exposes the right-hand tangent `applyToCamera` already computed internally for its pitch-rotation axis (`forward.cross(up)`, ignoring pitch) — same formula, now reusable for Main's strafe keys instead of being private to that one method.

First test attempt used a large one-shot distance and failed — a good reminder of a lesson from a few sessions back rather than a new bug: a big single step along a non-meridian, non-equatorial great circle drifts off constant theta as it goes, so "move due east by 10 units" doesn't stay due east for the whole 10 units away from the equator. Fixed by testing the same way the existing wall-thickness test already does — placed just inside the wall-zone, a small single-tick-sized step — rather than a large step from a cell's center.

Verified interactively: holding D for 30 simulated ticks moved the player sideways while `forward` stayed at `dot ~ 1.0` with its starting value (no view snap — just the minimal parallel-transport `moveAlong` already does to stay tangent) and covered less than the unobstructed distance once it reached a wall along the way, confirming collision applies to strafing exactly as it does to walking.

## 2026-07-16 — A permanent wall-slide stall, and Q/D pointing the wrong way

hooman came back after more playtesting with two more reports: getting permanently stuck whenever contact with a wall happened at an angle, and Q/D strafing backwards (Q went right, D went left — wanted the opposite of each).

**The stall was `slideAlong` deriving the wall's tangent from the wrong reference point.** It crossed the player's current position with the *blocked node's fixed nominal center* — accurate near that center, since that's essentially what the earlier pole-singularity fix (see the "Three more" entry above) needed, but nobody had exercised a slide that travels *far* along a wall before. Reproduced directly in the browser (temporary `window` hooks again, same technique as previous sessions): sliding at a shallow angle against a real generated-maze wall moved fine for ~30-45 ticks, then the per-tick distance visibly decayed and hit exactly zero, permanently. As the player's position keeps advancing along the wall while the reference point stays fixed at the blocked node's own row/column center, the cross-product-derived tangent rotates away from the true wall direction until the projected slide distance decays below the noise floor.

Fixed by deriving the tangent from the player's *own current* theta/phi instead, picking the axis (`thetaTangentAt` vs `phiTangentAt`) from which grid direction the wall is actually fixed on — a same-row neighbor pair means the wall runs north-south, a different-row (or pole) pair means it runs east-west. This stays exact arbitrarily far along the wall, since it's evaluated fresh at wherever the player actually is rather than referencing a point that recedes into the distance. The one exception kept the old cross-product formula: a pole endpoint, where phi is undefined at the pole itself — confirmed necessary by a regression in `testMoveAcrossAClosedEdgeIsBlockedAndLeavesPositionUnchanged` the first time this landed, whose seed happened to pick a pole-adjacent edge for its square-hit case.

Also found, while building the regression test, a good way to accidentally test the wrong thing: a hand-built maze with *nothing* open at all isn't a free-standing wall, it's a sealed corner (the slide direction's own north/south neighbors are closed too), and sliding into a genuine corner is supposed to stop — that's correct dead-end physics, not a bug, confirmed separately by checking the player could still back out or strafe away from it. The actual regression test (`testSlidingAlongTheSameWallForManyTicksDoesNotStall`) needed a real generated maze and a search for a cell with its east edge closed but north/south open for a few rows, mirroring the browser reproduction.

**Q/D were backwards because Heaps' camera is left-handed.** `Player.rightVector()` (`forward.cross(up)`) is the standard right-handed "right" — but `s3d.camera.rightHanded == false`, confirmed empirically by comparing it against the camera's own `getRight()`, which points the *opposite* way. So `+rightVector()` is actually screen-left and `-rightVector()` is screen-right here, exactly backwards from what the name suggests. `rightVector()` itself wasn't touched, since `applyToCamera`'s pitch axis depends on it too (flipping it there would flip which way looking up tilts) — the sign correction lives entirely in Main's Q/D wiring.

## 2026-07-16 — The wall-slide fix wasn't the whole story: a genuine permanent lockup

The slide-drift fix above turned out to only cover part of what hooman was hitting. Confirmed directly together: hooman drove into a wall corner and got stuck; a first pass reproduced a *different*, already-fixed case (a legitimate dead-end pocket, escapable by backing out) and nearly closed the loop on the wrong explanation. hooman insisted nothing actually freed them, which was the right call — a real bug remained.

**Root cause: retreating from a wall you're already touching couldn't fully exit its thickness in one tick.** `Maze.wallZoneNeighbor` blocks a candidate position that's still nominally within a closed side's rendered thickness — necessary so a player can't walk through a wall's visible face, but it had no notion of *which direction* the position moved relative to where the step started. Walking square-on into a wall (not at an angle) presses the player right up against its face, deep inside that zone — by design, since players are allowed to walk right up to a wall. But the zone is thicker than one fixed-timestep's step distance, so a *single* tick of retreating isn't enough to fully clear it. The old check saw "still inside the zone" and rejected the whole step, rolling all the way back to the exact starting position — and since a square hit also leaves nothing for `slideAlong` to redirect into (the same "approaching square-on leaves ~nothing to slide with" case documented for the angled-hit fix), every subsequent tick started from the identical spot and produced the identical non-result. Forever, in every direction — confirmed with the exact real per-tick step size (`WALK_SPEED * FIXED_DT`, not a large one-shot test distance), which is what actually exposed it: the initial "escaped by backing away" verification had used a single large `-1.0` step, big enough to jump clean over the whole thin zone in one shot, masking the bug entirely. This is the same "large one-shot distance doesn't match real per-tick movement" trap noted a few sessions running now.

Fixed by threading each tick's starting theta/phi through `wallZoneNeighbor`/`Collision.blockingNode` and only blocking a candidate that's *more* embedded in a zone than the tick started at — not simply "still nominally inside" it. A net retreat, or a sideways move that doesn't touch that axis at all, is now allowed even while technically still within the zone; only digging in further is rejected. Verified with a real per-tick-speed sweep across every closed wall in a generated maze (walk square-on into each one, then retreat) — zero permanent lockups, only legitimate slow sliding in a couple of very narrow one-cell-wide passages where retreating from one wall immediately engages the opposite one.

## 2026-07-16 — A collision clearance so the camera stops clipping through walls

Small follow-up hooman flagged in the same session: the player could walk right up flush against a wall's actual rendered face (zero gap, exactly as an earlier session's fix intended), close enough that the camera — sitting near `player.pos`, offset only for eye height — could catch glimpses past the wall's thin geometry, most noticeable while pitched up toward it.

Added `MazeGeometry.COLLISION_CLEARANCE` (1 unit), an extra buffer `Maze.wallZoneNeighbor` adds on top of `WALL_THICKNESS` purely for the collision check — `MazeMesh`'s rendered wall face is untouched, still built exactly `WALL_THICKNESS` in from the cell boundary. The player (and so the camera) now stops a bit short of that visible face instead of flush against it. Verified interactively: walking square into a wall and rendering the camera from the pressed position now shows a clear strip of floor between the camera and the wall, where before it sat flush against the geometry.

Widening the blocking zone meant two existing tests needed their own inset math updated to match — they'd been computing "just inside/outside the wall zone" using `WALL_THICKNESS` alone, which no longer matches the real blocking distance the code now uses. The square-on retreat test's assertion also needed rethinking: it originally required near-full-speed progress on every single retreat tick, but tracing through revealed a real (if minor) side effect of the sphere's curvature — no row sits exactly on the equator (`Maze.ROWS - 1` is odd), so "due east" isn't quite a geodesic away from it, and `forward` drifts slightly off being exactly wall-perpendicular over a multi-tick approach, throttling a handful of ticks on both the approach and the retreat symmetrically. Not a bug, just not compatible with a fixed per-tick minimum — rewrote the assertion around signed net displacement (did retreating actually move phi back away from the wall, past a large majority of the gap) instead, which the fix genuinely satisfies. Should be caught early, is not to be re-litigated as a lockup if seen again — it's the same well-understood curvature effect noted several times prior in this log, not a new class of bug.

## 2026-07-16 — Bigger sphere, wider corridors

hooman asked for the sphere 1.5x bigger and the space between walls 2x wider — two separate multipliers, not one "scale everything up" ask.

Bumping `MazeGeometry.RADIUS` alone (as the class doc has said since it was introduced) only gets you the first part — corridor width scales directly with `RADIUS` at a *fixed* `Maze.ROWS`/`COLS`, so a 1.5x radius bump alone would have widened corridors by roughly that same 1.5x, not a separate 2x. A wall is nothing more than a cell boundary at this grid resolution, so the only way to decouple "how big is the sphere" from "how much space is between its walls" is to also change the resolution itself — confirmed with the user before touching it, since dropping the resolution makes the maze noticeably sparser (fewer cells, fewer turns) as an unavoidable side effect, not just a visual change.

`RADIUS` 58->87 (1.5x). `Maze.ROWS`/`COLS` 16/32->14/28, derived to land corridor width at roughly 2x its old value (worked backwards from wanting the walkable interior — cell width minus `2*WALL_THICKNESS` on each axis — to double, holding `WALL_THICKNESS` itself unchanged, then solved for the column/row count that gets there at the new radius; landed within ~3% of exactly 2x on both axes). Net effect: ~25% fewer cells than before, on a bigger sphere, with visibly roomier corridors — not a uniformly scaled-up copy of the old maze.

All existing tests passed unchanged (they're parameterized off `Maze.ROWS`/`COLS`/`MazeGeometry.RADIUS`, not hardcoded against the old values). Verified interactively too: screenshotted the new maze (visibly wider corridors, sparser layout), then re-ran the same full-maze wall-contact sweep from the collision-clearance fix above (walk square-on into every closed wall, then retreat) at the new scale — 564 contacts tested, zero lockups.

## 2026-07-17 — Menu design: a diegetic hub sphere, not a UI overlay

hooman had been sitting on an undecided question: build the usual menu/options screen as a standard 2D overlay, or integrate it into the game world instead. Talked through the tradeoff before deciding anything — the overlay is cheap to build and iterate on while core mechanics (movement, collision, the maze mesh) are still actively shifting, and doesn't lock in assumptions about camera/input/pacing before those settle; the diegetic route is a real design commitment that's expensive to redo once content is built around it, but fits the game's identity better, since "raise your head, see across the sphere" (README's own opening line) already leans on spatial/diegetic mechanics rather than UI chrome.

**Decided: diegetic.** Rejected the standard overlay specifically because this game's whole hook is *not* breaking out of the sphere-interior viewpoint — a modal 2D menu would be the one moment the game drops that premise, for the single system (options/navigation) that's arguably easiest to keep in-world instead.

**The concrete shape:** a **hub** — its own sphere, separate from any generated maze/biome, serving the role `docs/rules/guidelines.md` §1.5's FSM already reserves for a `Menu` state, except the state *is* a place rather than a screen. Paintings scattered through every biome's walls are the doorways back to the hub, reachable near-anywhere without a dedicated pause keypress. Inside the hub, paintings of every biome discovered so far let the player travel back into any of them. This is also the first concrete use of two previously-parked README backlog ideas — "Paintings mechanics" and "Various levels... paintings could be the link between biomes/levels" — landing as the menu/navigation system itself rather than a separate gameplay layer bolted on later.

Nothing implemented yet — this entry records the decision and its rejected alternative before the implementation plan (walked through separately with hooman) lands.

## 2026-07-18 — Multi-biome restructuring: Biome contract, Space seam, BiomeRegistry, Entity foundation

hooman flagged that the codebase — one hardcoded maze biome plus a hardcoded hub, wired together in `Main` by a binary `SceneKind` switch — wouldn't hold up once several more biomes exist (compass, candlelight, wind, ... per `docs/open/ideas-backlog.md`'s backlog), each with shared mechanisms (collision) and entities (traveling NPCs, spawned creatures) reused across them. Talked through the shape before touching code, including whether future biomes are guaranteed to be sphere-shaped (no — explicit freedom for a genuinely different topology later) and whether the hub is conceptually different from a biome (no — it already had everything a biome has, just special-cased).

**Decided, in four ordered steps (see the restructuring plan discussed with hooman for the full reasoning):**

1. **`game.Space`/`game.SphereSpace`** — extracted `Player`'s rotation-around-axis math (hardcoded "sphere centered at the world origin") behind an interface. Only one implementation exists; this is the seam a non-spherical biome would need later, not a second topology built speculatively.
2. **`game.Biome`, `biomes.MazeBiome`, `biomes.HubBiome`** — the hub became a peer `Biome` implementation, not a second `SceneKind`. Rejected keeping the hub special-cased: it already had its own build/collision/spawn/painting, so treating it differently was the same hardcoded-single-case problem the maze had, one level up. `hub.Painting`'s `ToHub`/`ToBiome` enum — which only existed because the hub was special-cased — collapsed into a plain `destinationBiomeId:String`, symmetric in both directions.
3. **`world.BiomeRegistry`** — closed the "discovered biomes" gap this file's own 2026-07-17 entry flagged. A biome is a single shared instance per world, not regenerated per player/party (relevant once multiplayer — a real future goal, just not imminent — puts several players in different biomes at once). `world.Painting` moved out of `hub/`, since it's genuinely biome-agnostic now.
4. **`game.Process`/`entities.Entity`, `world.CreatureSpawnTable`, `world.NpcRegistry`** — built the `Process`/`Entity` foundation `CLAUDE.md`'s Architecture section already committed to (deferred pending a second use case; cross-biome entities are that use case), with `Player` migrated onto it as the first real `Entity`. Two different entity lifecycles were named explicitly rather than conflated: spawned creatures (data-driven, per-biome, ephemeral — `CreatureSpawnTable`) versus traveling NPCs (persistent `{biomeId, pos}`, fixed/triggered location only, no background simulation — `NpcRegistry`). Neither is wired into a biome's `build()` yet: there's no actual creature/NPC `Entity` type to instantiate, and building that integration against fabricated placeholder content would be exactly the kind of premature design `docs/rules/philosophy.md`'s "prototype unproven mechanics before committing" pillar warns against.

**Explicitly deferred, not forgotten:** persistence (save state, eventually "join another's world" — backlogged, no urgency); a second `Space` implementation; any simulation/rendering split for multiplayer (state stays data-driven/event-driven so this remains possible, but nothing beyond that is built now); the first actual second biome (compass/candlelight/etc.) — the `Biome` contract is what makes that a small, isolated addition once it's actually designed, not part of this restructuring itself.

**Same-day follow-up, step 5:** a fresh read flagged two loose ends the four steps above left behind — `game.Collision` sat in the "generic" `game/` package despite being entirely maze-grid-specific (predates this restructuring; none of the four steps touched it), and `maze/`/`hub/` sat as top-level siblings of `biomes/` rather than nested under it (a deliberate step-2 scoping choice, not a final design). hooman's framing resolved it: **"Maze is, after all, a biome, isn't it?"** — the grid topology + wall-thickness collision is genuinely shared substrate a future grid-based biome (compass/candlelight) likely reuses as-is, but the maze's own spanning-tree generation algorithm is specifically what makes it a *maze*, exactly as the hub's room/column content is specific to the hub. Confirmed by a concrete smell: `hub.Hub` already reached into `maze.MazeMesh` for two rendering helpers (`addQuad`, `WALL_TEXTURE_TILE_SIZE`) that have nothing to do with grids — "reused from Maze" by a biome that isn't grid-based at all.

Split into `grid/` (new: `Grid`, `GridGeometry`, `GridMesh`, `GridCollision` — substrate, not owned by one biome), `game.MeshBuilder` (new: the two generic mesh helpers, so `Hub` no longer touches anything grid-related), and `biomes.maze.MazeGenerator` (new: the spanning-tree algorithm, the maze biome's own content). Then nested each biome's adapter next to its own content: `biomes/maze/` (`MazeBiome`, `MazeGenerator`, `MazeExitWall`) and `biomes/hub/` (`HubBiome`, `Hub`, `HubCollision`). `grid/` itself stays a top-level sibling of `biomes/`, not nested under `biomes/maze/` — it's infrastructure a future biome can depend on directly, not the maze's own.

**Same-day follow-up, step 6 — MVC-flavored naming, not MVC-flavored folders:** hooman remained only half-convinced by the `game/grid/entities/biomes/world` split above and asked whether an MVC-equivalent top-level structure would be better. Talked through why literal `model/`/`view/`/`controller/` folders would be wrong here before touching anything: a biome's model, rendering, and collision are coupled by construction (`GridMesh` and `GridCollision` must agree on wall geometry pixel-for-pixel), so splitting them into distant top-level trees would re-scatter exactly what step 5 had just consolidated into `biomes/maze/`. Worked through hooman's own counter-proposal piece by piece rather than presenting a single finished plan, converging on: keep `Model`/`Mesh`/`Collision`/`Biome` *naming* to signal the same distinction MVC cares about, but keep each feature's files physically together; fold genuinely-shared-but-not-universal infrastructure (the grid, the sphere-space math) into `biomes/common/` instead of scattering it as top-level siblings of `biomes/`.

**Decisions made along the way, each hooman's own explicit call:**
- Sphere-specific code (`Space`, `SphereSpace`, `SphereMath`) all stays bundled together under `biomes/common/space/sphere/`, however deep that nests — "depth costs nothing."
- `Hub` splits the same way `Grid`/`GridMesh` already had: `HubModel` (state/pure queries) versus `HubMesh` (actual scene-graph building).
- `Player` moves back into `entities/` (as `entities.player.PlayerModel`) rather than staying a `game/` top-level sibling — it's an `Entity`, and belongs there conceptually as much as physically. Its camera-placement logic split out into a separate stateless `entities.player.Camera`.
- `CreaturesRegistry` (new, runtime bookkeeping) is deliberately distinguished from `CreatureSpawnTable` (config/schema) rather than merged, and both moved under `entities/` — the registries specifically into `entities/registries/`, even though `BiomesRegistry` isn't itself about entities, for one consistent home.
- `Painting` becomes `entities.painting.PaintingModel`, an `Entity` — but only the warp-linked shape (`destinationBiomeId`/`triggerDistance`); a purely decorative painting with no mechanism behind it isn't a real use case yet, so nothing was built to anticipate it (same "don't build ahead of need" discipline `CreatureSpawnTable`'s own doc already states).
- Scattered color constants (`Painting.TO_HUB_COLOR`/`TO_BIOME_COLOR`, `GridMesh.FLOOR_COLOR`, `HubMesh.FLOOR_COLOR_A`/`FLOOR_COLOR_B`) consolidated into a new `graphics.Colours` — mechanical, not a new palette.
- `Main` shrinks to the bare `hxd.App` lifecycle plus the fixed-timestep accumulator; everything else it used to do directly (biome setup/switching, input handling, the debug overlay, export/import dev tooling) moved onto a new `game.GameLoop`, threaded the Heaps scene handles it needs through its constructor since it isn't an `hxd.App` subclass itself.

`world/` is now fully retired — `BiomesRegistry`/`NpcsRegistry`/`CreatureSpawnTable`/`PaintingModel` all moved under `entities/`, and the empty directory removed. Executed as ten small, independently green commits (compile/lint/test/visual-check after each), same discipline as every step before it. Couldn't visually re-confirm the Hub split or the F3 debug overlay specifically through the browser tool — synthetic key input doesn't reliably reach `hxd.Key` in this environment (a pre-existing, already-documented limitation) — relied on the full passing test suite plus careful line-for-line porting for those two instead.

## 2026-07-18 — SPACE retired from camera tilt, freed for jump

Kicking off jump + a new vertical tower biome (design discussion, not yet built past this first slice). First decision: `GameLoop.updateSpaceTilt` already bound held-SPACE to tilting the camera up toward the sphere's center — the "see far, not near" pillar mechanic (`docs/rules/philosophy.md`) — with an auto-release-while-moving quirk on top. hooman's call: retire that mechanic entirely rather than find a tap/hold split, and hand SPACE to jump outright.

This doesn't actually cost the pillar mechanic itself: mouse-look already drives `player.lookUp` independently (`GameLoop.onMouseMove`), so raising your head to see across the sphere still works exactly as before — only the keyboard-only forced-tilt-with-auto-release variant is gone. Removed `spaceHoldTime`/`spaceTiltReleased`/`SPACE_TILT_RELEASE_AFTER`/`PITCH_SPEED`/`updateSpaceTilt`/`isMoveKeyDown` from `GameLoop`, and `Keybinds.TILT_UP` — SPACE is unbound to anything until jump claims it in the next slice.

## 2026-07-18 — Jump, gravity-per-biome, and a new vertical tower biome

Landed the rest of what the SPACE-tilt removal above was clearing room for, in five more small commits.

**Jump + gravity, every biome.** `Biome.radius()` turned out to be dead: its only caller (`GameLoop`'s `Camera.applyTo`) never actually read the parameter it fed. Dropped both, and replaced `radius()` with `gravity():Float` + `applyGravity(player, dt):Void` — landing is each biome's own collision concern, same reasoning `tryMove` already gets. `PlayerModel` gained `verticalVelocity`/`grounded`/`jump()`/`airborneHeight`; the hub and maze share one tiny helper (`biomes.common.Gravity.fallToSurface`) that integrates gravity into `airborneHeight` — a cosmetic offset added along the biome's own "up," never touching `pos` — and clamps back to the surface the instant it would go below it, since their floor is present everywhere. `Keybinds.JUMP` claims SPACE.

**FlatSpace.** Every biome until now walked a sphere's interior surface — `Space` itself was already written generically, but `SphereSpace` was its only implementation. Added `biomes.common.space.flat.FlatSpace`: fixed `+Y` up, straight-line movement, no curvature to parallel-transport across.

**The tower.** A vertical shaft (`biomes.tower`, following the `Model`/`Generator`/`Mesh`/`Collision`/`Biome` split `biomes.common.grid`/`biomes.maze` already establish): each layer is a small always-solid center disk surrounded by concentric rings, each ring cut into tiles that shear further per ring (`TowerModel.RING_ANGLE_STEP`) so the cross-section reads as camera-aperture blades rather than a plain pie chart. `TowerGenerator` makes each layer's own ring tiles solid independently at random, at a density that interpolates from `FLOOR_DENSITY_START` down to `FLOOR_DENSITY_END` across the descent — harder to find footing the deeper it goes. The bottom-most layer is always forced fully solid, so a fall always eventually lands somewhere real.

Unlike the hub/maze's cosmetic hop, the tower's own `TowerCollision.applyGravity` is real free-fall: gravity accelerates `player.pos.y` with no cap, and landing scans every layer boundary a step crosses (not just the one the player started in) so an increasingly fast fall can never tunnel through a solid floor by covering more than one layer in a single fixed step. Gravity itself (`TowerBiome.GRAVITY`) is lighter than the hub/maze's — "slightly decreased," per the ask.

Reaching the bottom (`TowerModel.GOAL_LEVELS`, tracked as `deepestLayerReached` — a running max, so jumping back upward mid-fall never un-gates it once earned) unlocks a return painting mounted on the outer wall right there. Making that possible needed one more generalization: `Biome.exitPainting():PaintingModel` became `exitPaintings():Array<PaintingModel>`, read fresh every tick instead of cached at entry (the tower's own painting appears mid-visit), and the hub's own single hardcoded to-biome face became a `DESTINATIONS` list (`HubBiome`) so it could mount a second painting — to the tower — alongside the maze's, with `spawnPlayer` gaining a `fromBiomeId` parameter so a returning player lands in front of whichever face they actually came from.

All of the tower's own numbers (level count, radii, ring/tile counts, the density curve, gravity) are first-pass — expected to be retuned by feel once this is actually playable, same discipline `GridGeometry`'s own constants went through. The secret one-time-painting-swap idea discussed alongside this (going back up through the tower's own entrance instead of descending) is logged in `docs/open/ideas-backlog.md`'s backlog, not built.

## 2026-07-18 — Tower visuals: real textures, real relief, a second painting

Follow-up pass on the tower once its own concept-art painting (`res/sprites/painting--biome-tower-01.png`, added alongside the rest of `PaintingModel`'s move to real artwork) gave something concrete to build toward: a circular stone floor built from overlapping angled slabs, around a dark, weathered masonry room.

**The floor tiles didn't actually fit together.** Tracked "rings not lining up" to a real geometric bug, not a tuning issue: adjacent rings almost always have *different* tile counts (`TowerModel.tilesForRing` scales up per ring), so each ring's own outer/inner edge approximated their *shared* boundary circle with a different-sided polygon — a hexagon meeting a 12-gon meeting an 18-gon, each cutting a slightly different chord across the same nominal radius. Exactly the class of bug `biomes.common.grid.GridMesh`'s own wall-corner history already found once, just for a ring boundary instead of a row one. Fixed the same way: introduced `TowerModel.ANGULAR_SEGMENTS` (72 — the LCM of every ring's own tile count), a shared grid every ring boundary and the center disk's own rim samples identically regardless of that ring's tile count. `RING_ANGLE_STEP` became `RING_ANGLE_STEP_SLOTS` (whole shared-grid slots, not a raw angle) so a ring's own tile boundaries always land exactly on that grid too; `tileAt` now goes through the same `slotAt`/`tileIndexAtSlot` mapping `TowerMesh` walks directly, so collision and rendering can never disagree about where one tile ends and the next begins.

**Real relief.** Floor tiles were flat, zero-thickness planes — "not even 3 dimensional," per the ask. `TowerMesh` now extrudes every solid tile (and the center disk) down by `TILE_THICKNESS`, with a side wall only where the neighboring tile/ring/disk *isn't* itself solid — otherwise that face would sit exactly coincident with its solid neighbor's own, the same flickering z-fight `GridMesh`'s `WallBuilder` history already ran into once solved by the identical "don't render a face two solid pieces would share" rule.

**Textures.** No image-generation tool available and no PIL/numpy installed in this environment, so both new textures (`res/textures/tower_stone_wall.png`, `tower_stone_floor.png`) are hand-written PNGs (stdlib `zlib`/`struct` only) — same "procedurally generated placeholder" discipline `wall_stone.png` already established. The wall is an ordinary tiling brick pattern, darker and warmer than `wall_stone.png` to read as its own place; the floor is a single non-tiling medallion decal (absolute-position UVs, not per-tile repeat) drawn at the tower's own actual `CENTER_DISK_RADIUS`/`OUTER_RADIUS`/`RINGS_PER_LAYER` ratios, so its baked-in ring/blade art lines up with the real geometry sitting on it.

**A second painting.** hooman flagged that the tower's only painting (gated at the very bottom) meant giving up partway down left no way back to the hub at all. Generalized `TowerModel.returnPaintingWallEdge` into `paintingWallEdge(layer, left)` and gave `TowerBiome.exitPaintings()` an always-available entrance painting at the top (layer 0) alongside the existing goal painting at the bottom — both lead to the hub, only the gating differs.

## 2026-07-18 — ZQSD keys now auto-fit any keyboard layout

The 2026-07-16 ZQSD hardcode (`hxd.Key.Z/Q/S/D`) only worked because it happened to match AZERTY; a QWERTY player's physical W/A/S/D keys would send different `keyCode`s and never register. Root cause: `hxd.Key` on the JS/WebGL target (checked against the installed Heaps 2.1.0 source, `hxd/Window.js.hx`) only ever forwards the browser's legacy, deprecated `KeyboardEvent.keyCode`, which reflects the *layout-mapped label* on a key, not its hardware position — and `hxd.Event`/`hxd.Key` have no field for anything else.

Rather than detect the layout and pick between two hardcoded key sets (which still wouldn't generalize past AZERTY/QWERTY), switched the four movement-strafe bindings to `KeyboardEvent.code` — the spec-standardized physical-position identifier, always named after its US-QWERTY equivalent regardless of what's printed on the keycap. New `game.PhysicalKeys` listens for `code` directly on `window` (capture phase, since Heaps' own canvas-level handler calls `stopPropagation()` on every key event by default and would otherwise swallow it before a bubble-phase listener saw it) — `hxd.Key` never sees this and isn't touched. `Keybinds.MOVE_FORWARD_ALT`/`MOVE_BACKWARD_ALT`/`STRAFE_LEFT`/`STRAFE_RIGHT` now hold `"KeyW"/"KeyS"/"KeyA"/"KeyD"` (`GameLoop.fixedUpdate` routes them through `PhysicalKeys.isDown` instead of `hxd.Key.isDown`), which is the physical WASD-position key on *any* layout — AZERTY's ZQSD keys sit in exactly that position, so this needed no AZERTY-specific code at all, and holds for other layouts (QWERTZ, Dvorak, …) the same way. Arrows/Shift/Space/F3/E/L stay on `hxd.Key` — they aren't letter keys, so `keyCode`'s layout-dependence never applied to them.

## 2026-07-18 — Two tower physics bugs, one root cause; the painting frame's own gap closed

hooman reported three things after playing with the tower's new relief: falling and brushing the side of a tile raised the player back up instead of blocking the step and continuing the fall, jumping was flat-out impossible on the topmost layer, and the painting frame still showed a visible gap against its own artwork despite looking "very plane."

**Both tower bugs traced back to the same line.** `TowerCollision.applyGravity`'s landing scan always re-checked `fromLayer = TowerModel.layerAt(oldY)` itself, on the assumption that whenever it came up solid, the player had just landed there. Two ways that assumption broke:
1. Jumping from layer 0: `layerAt` clamps to layer 0 (there's no layer "-1" to represent rising off the topmost floor), so the very first tick after leaving the ground rescanned layer 0, found it solid again (spawn sits on the always-solid center disk), and snapped straight back down — jump appeared to do nothing at all.
2. Drifting sideways while already falling *through* a layer's own gap: tiles now have real thickness (`TowerMesh`'s relief work, same session), so brushing under a solid tile's underside at a layer already fallen past read as landing on *top* of it, snapping the player back up through a floor they'd already left behind.

Fixed both with one change: the landing scan only runs at all while `newY <= oldY` (skips entirely while rising — nothing to land on while moving away from the floor, which is what actually unblocked the layer-0 jump), and within that scan, `fromLayer` itself is only re-checked when `oldY` still sits exactly at its floor height (still resting there) rather than strictly below it (already fell through). Two new `TowerCollisionTest` cases pin down each scenario directly.

**The painting frame's gap** was a real depth mismatch, not a tuning issue: `buildFrame`'s inner ("peak") edge sat `FRAME_DEPTH` *further out* than the painting's own surface (`buildQuad`'s `SURFACE_INSET`), meant to read as trim standing proud of the artwork — but nothing was ever built to fill the resulting step between the two, so the seam showed empty space. Fixed by making the frame's inner edge sit at exactly `SURFACE_INSET` (flush with the painting, same depth and extent) and moving the "proud" relief to the *outer* edge instead (recessed toward the wall) — the frame now bevels up from wall-depth to the artwork's own surface with no gap at either boundary, the more common real picture-frame profile anyway.

Also added, per the same ask: two thin black `FixedColor` outline bands (`buildOutline`), eaten out of the frame's own existing footprint right at its outer (wall) and inner (painting) borders rather than added beyond it — this project's flat/unlit shading has no real lighting to read the frame's relief from at all, so a traced keyline stands in for one, same "fake the depth with a dark line" discipline the stone textures' own mortar/seam lines already use.

## 2026-07-18 — The hub's own paintings were sunk into the floor

hooman screenshotted a hub column painting with its lower half buried in the grass. `HubModel.PAINTING_HEIGHT` (`57`) was originally derived by comparing the quad's own top edge against `COLUMN_HALF_HEIGHT` alone (get it as high on the column as it can go without poking through the cap) — sound as a pure height comparison, but it missed that the *floor* right around the column sits at very nearly that same height too: the sphere's own surface at radius `COLUMN_RADIUS` from the axis is, by construction, exactly `COLUMN_HALF_HEIGHT` up (that's the whole "flush end caps" design), and stays within a handful of units of that for a real distance out from the column — this is deep in "near the pole" territory, where the sphere's surface is steep. Mounting a painting near the column's own cap puts it right at the same latitude the floor is already climbing toward, at the same latitude the player is forced to view it from (see `PAINTING_HEIGHT`'s own doc on why that's unavoidable) — so it read as sunk into the ground rather than mounted on a wall.

Pure algebra kept giving the wrong answer here (tried raising the mount point analytically first — overshot badly, moved it out of frame entirely), so switched to confirming empirically: a temporary debug spawn dropped the camera at the exact return-spawn position a real returning player lands at, screenshotted across a spread of `PAINTING_HEIGHT` values. `61` is where it actually reads as mounted on the wall rather than sunk into the floor — not the highest value that clears `COLUMN_HALF_HEIGHT` on paper, which turned out not to be the same thing. Re-verified the return-spawn trigger-safety margin (`RETURN_SPAWN_ARC_OFFSET`'s own reasoning) still holds at the new height — it does, with more margin than before, not less.

## 2026-07-18 — The pole squeeze was real: bigger paintings needed a bigger trigger radius, not just a taller mount

The `61` fix above still wasn't right — hooman's next screenshot showed the same painting sunk again, worse, and asked for every painting (hub included) to be much bigger, filling its own wall almost edge to edge. Wrote an actual bisection script (not hand algebra, following the previous entry's own lesson) checking the *worst case* a player can reach before `PAINTING_TRIGGER_DISTANCE` warps them away, at a spread of mount heights: the finding was that **no** mount height works at the old trigger distance (`6`) — the true floor-to-cap gap at the closest reachable approach is under `1.5` units everywhere, nowhere near enough for a painting anywhere close to this project's usual size (`~7` units). Raising the mount alone just traded "sunk in the floor" for "overshoots `COLUMN_HALF_HEIGHT`" at a slightly different height; both bugs, never fixed at once.

The actual lever was `PAINTING_TRIGGER_DISTANCE` itself: pushing it out forces the closest reachable approach further from the pole, where the sphere's own floor is meaningfully lower (the surface is steep right at the pole, shallow a bit further out). Raised it `6`→`20`, re-ran the bisection, and got real room: `PAINTING_HEIGHT` (now the painting's own *bottom* edge directly, not a base-height-plus-offset) = `57.4558`, total height `PAINTING_HEIGHT_SPAN` = `9.0199`, both confirmed `0.3` clear of the floor at the worst case and `0.3` clear of `COLUMN_HALF_HEIGHT` at the top. `RETURN_SPAWN_ARC_OFFSET` needed the same re-derivation (`6`→`24`) since the old value no longer cleared the new, much bigger trigger sphere — confirmed numerically it wouldn't have (margin would've been *negative* 11 units, an instant re-trigger bouncing the player straight back out).

**"Much bigger" needed threading through every painting, not just the hub's.** `PaintingModel`'s own `BASE_HEIGHT`/`HEIGHT` were fixed absolute constants shared by every mount; replaced with explicit `baseHeight`/`height` parameters on `centerOf`/`buildQuad`/`buildFrame`/`buildOutline`, plus a new `fillWall(availableHeight)` helper (small `MARGIN_FRACTION` margin, fills the rest) for the ordinary "floor to ceiling" cases: `MazeBiome`'s own exit painting now fills `GridMesh.WALL_HEIGHT`, and the tower's own top/bottom paintings fill `LAYER_HEIGHT - TILE_THICKNESS` — not the full layer gap, since the ring immediately above hangs its own floor's relief down by `TILE_THICKNESS` (moved from `TowerMesh` to `TowerModel`, since `TowerBiome`'s own trigger-position math needs it too now) — a second reported bug (the bottom painting clipping into the layer above) fixed by the same change. `WIDTH_FRACTION` bumped `0.5`→`0.92` across the board. The hub's own bespoke (non-`fillWall`) numbers are the one exception, for the reasons above.

**A third, unrelated bug surfaced once the hub paintings were actually fully visible for the first time:** the tower-destination one read as upside down. Root cause: `HubMesh.buildColumn` passes `up = (0,1,0)` to keep the quad flush with the column's own vertical face panel — geometrically necessary — but a player standing close enough to read it is deep in "near the pole" territory, where *their own* up (`SphereSpace`'s "toward center" convention, same one their camera itself uses) points close to the *opposite* direction. Mounting the artwork's own top row at the geometrically-flush end therefore reads as upside down to the one person actually looking at it. The tower's own paintings never had this problem — `FlatSpace.upAt` is genuinely `(0,1,0)`, no inversion — which is why only the hub ones ever flipped. Fixed with a new `PaintingModel.buildQuad` parameter, `imageUpMatchesUp` (default `true`): when `false`, swaps which edge gets the texture's own top row without touching the geometry at all. `HubMesh` is the one caller that passes `false`.

## 2026-07-18 — Still sinking, still too big, and a real fillWall bug

Next screenshot round: the hub painting was sinking again (worse than the previous fix), the maze's own exit painting read as too big, the tower's read as slightly too big — "touching the wall and the ceiling" — and the hub's own trigger radius felt absurd ("pulls you from a kilometer away").

**`fillWall` had a real bug, not just an aggressive default.** It sized its `margin` against the *inner painting* alone, but `buildFrame`'s own border extends `height * FRAME_BORDER_FRACTION` further out on every edge — so the frame's own outer edge could (and on the tower, did) overflow past the wall height `fillWall` was told to respect. Fixed by solving for the inner painting's own height such that the *frame's* outer edge is what lands `MARGIN_FRACTION` inside `availableHeight`, not the bare quad. Paired with dialing back both `MARGIN_FRACTION` (`0.06`→`0.15`) and `WIDTH_FRACTION` (`0.92`→`0.78`) — the previous round's "as big as possible" reading was too literal; both maze and tower needed a visibly bigger gap around the edges.

**The hub's own trigger distance was the wrong lever, pushed too far.** `PAINTING_TRIGGER_DISTANCE` at `20` bought geometric room by keeping players far from the pole — but it also meant the painting activated from `20` units away, nowhere near where a player would naturally be standing to look at it. Re-ran the bisection with `16` instead (comfortably past the bare minimum needed to dodge a re-trigger, nowhere near `20`) and a bigger safety margin (`0.3`→`0.5` on both the floor and the cap side), this time correctly measured against `buildFrame`'s own outer edge rather than the inner painting (the same bug `fillWall` had, present here too since the hub's own sizing is bespoke, not routed through `fillWall`). Landed on `PAINTING_HEIGHT` (bottom edge) `60.544`, `PAINTING_HEIGHT_SPAN` `5.357` — noticeably smaller than the previous round's `9.0199`, and deliberately so: for this one mounting spot, "doesn't sink, doesn't overshoot, doesn't grab the player from far away" won out over "as big as possible." `RETURN_SPAWN_ARC_OFFSET` followed the trigger distance down, `24`→`19`.

## 2026-07-18 — The tower painting needed a jump to trigger; the hub still pulled from too far

Two more rounds of the same feedback loop: the hub painting still activated from too far away even at `16`, and separately, the tower's own bottom painting turned out to need the player right up against the wall *and* a jump to trigger at all — never reported before since nobody had tried triggering it from a normal walking approach until now.

**Root cause, shared by both:** `TowerBiome.wallPainting`/`HubModel.toBiomePainting` built their `PaintingModel`'s own trigger position via `centerOf` — the painting's actual, wall-mounted-height visual center — while `player.pos` (what `triggeredBy` actually compares against) is a *feet*-level point. `biomes.maze.MazeBiome.exitPaintings`, the one that "behaves perfectly" per direct feedback, was never wired this way — it always triggered off `midpointOf`, the wall's own floor-level reference. For the tower specifically, the vertical gap between a feet-level `pos` and a wall-mounted-height center was, on its own, already bigger than `PaintingModel.TRIGGER_DISTANCE` (`4`) — the painting was structurally untriggerable by walking, only reachable by jumping to momentarily close that gap. For the hub, the same mismatch was just quietly eating into `PAINTING_TRIGGER_DISTANCE`'s own budget rather than making the painting untriggerable outright, since the hub's own distance was already large.

Switched both to `midpointOf`, matching maze exactly — this alone fixes the tower (its own painting still fills the same `fillWall`-derived size and position, just triggers correctly now that the reference point matches where the player's own `pos` actually is). `PaintingModel.centerOf` is now unused everywhere and was removed.

For the hub, fixing the reference point is what finally made a *small* trigger distance viable: re-ran the bisection with `midpointOf` (rather than the elevated center) as both the trigger reference *and* the worst-case-approach measurement, and `PAINTING_TRIGGER_DISTANCE` came down to `10` (from `16`) with the same `0.5` safety margin intact. `PAINTING_HEIGHT`/`PAINTING_HEIGHT_SPAN` shrank again as the direct cost (`63.457`/`2.634`, down from `60.544`/`5.357`) — a noticeably thinner, "letterbox" painting now, the real price of a trigger radius that finally feels like a normal walk-up-to-it distance rather than a wide net. `RETURN_SPAWN_ARC_OFFSET` followed, `19`→`12`.

## 2026-07-18 — The hub's own column, removed: paintings move into two landmark buildings

Every one of the fixes in the five entries above was chasing the same underlying trap: the octagonal column mounted a to-biome painting on a face sitting deep in "near the pole" territory, where the sphere's own floor rises to meet the column's own end cap within a fraction of a unit — a genuine, numerically-confirmed squeeze between "big enough to read as a painting" and "doesn't sink into the floor or poke through the cap," not something further bisection could ever fully resolve. hooman's ask replaced the mechanism outright: "buildings in [the hub], which will remind one of each biome. The paintings to each biome will be in each building" — a small maze-spiral shrine and a miniature tower replica, placed anywhere reachable. Asked directly whether the column should stay as pure decoration once paintings moved out — hooman: remove it entirely, since mounting the paintings was its only job.

**`biomes.hub.HubStructure`** is the new shared foundation both buildings are built and collided against in: a fixed local tangent-plane frame (`anchorAt(theta, phi, radius)` → `{origin, up, uAxis, vAxis}`, from `SphereMath.upVectorAt`/`phiTangentAt`/`thetaTangentAt` directly, already mutually perpendicular) anchored at one point on the hub sphere. Valid because both buildings are small (tens of units) against `HubModel.RADIUS` (70) — the curvature across either one's own footprint is negligible, so treating each as flat local `(u, v)` is a reasonable, much simpler approximation than wrapping either around the sphere the way a full biome's own geometry has to. This is also the key simplification the redesign unlocks: away from either pole, a structure's own local "up" genuinely matches a nearby player's perceived up, so painting mounts need nothing beyond the ordinary `PaintingModel.fillWall` + default `buildQuad` — no bisection scripts, no `imageUpMatchesUp` workaround, no bespoke trigger-distance tuning.

**`biomes.hub.MazeShrine`**: seven `wall_stone` walls at `GridMesh.WALL_HEIGHT`, laid out as a single square spiral via a turtle-walk (arm `i` is `i * ARM_UNIT` long, direction cycling every turn) rather than the maze's own lat/long grid — that grid exists to wrap a whole biome around a sphere, which a decorative structure this size has no need of. The maze's own painting mounts on wall 2 (counting from the center), matching "the second from the center" exactly.

**`biomes.hub.TowerReplica`**: a small solid mini-spire — corrected mid-plan after hooman caught the first draft's mistake ("have the painting be on the lowest floor, not the top one. The player will have no way to get up there"): unlike the real tower, this is a facade with no interior and no way up at all, `FLOORS` (4) purely cosmetic belt-course ledges (`addFrustumBand`'s own step-out/rise/step-in, reused for both the main cylindrical wall and each ledge — the same shape wall, ledge-riser, and ledge-cap all reduce to) rather than real per-floor collision. The painting mounts on the outer wall at ground level.

**A real geometry bug surfaced building the tower replica's own painting, not just a tuning question:** `paintingWallEdge`'s two edges sit on the true circle, but `PaintingModel.buildQuad` mounts a flat quad between them, inset off that flat chord — the actual curved wall bulges toward the chord by the arc's own sagitta (`radius * (1 - cos(halfAngle))`) in between. An initial `PAINTING_HALF_ANGLE` (`0.47`) at the spire's own small `OUTER_RADIUS` (`5.5`) put that bulge (`0.6`) past `SURFACE_INSET` (`0.4`) entirely — the curved wall poked out in front of the recessed painting partway along its own width, showing as two separate slivers of artwork with solid wall between them (caught in-browser, not just by inspection: the real tower has the exact same shape of tolerance, `0.449` sagitta against the same `0.4` inset, but at its much bigger radius the same absolute bulge is a tiny fraction of the wall's own scale and never read as broken). Fixed by widening `OUTER_RADIUS` to `7.5` and narrowing `PAINTING_HALF_ANGLE` to `0.2` — sagitta `0.15`, comfortably clear.

**Wiring:** `HubModel` stripped down to just `RADIUS`/`SPAWN_THETA`/`SPAWN_PHI` — every column-specific constant (`COLUMN_RADIUS`, `PAINTING_HEIGHT`, `PAINTING_TRIGGER_DISTANCE`, `isInside`, `toBiomePainting`, …) is gone with it. `HubMesh.build` is shell + grass only now, taking an `isWalkable` predicate rather than a paintings list, since each structure textures and mounts its own painting itself. `HubBiome` anchors both structures at fixed `(theta, phi)` 120 degrees apart from each other and from `SPAWN_PHI` (an ordinary placement choice now, not a pole-adjacency requirement), dispatches `spawnPlayer`'s returning case to whichever structure's own `returnSpawn` matches `fromBiomeId`, and combines both structures' own `blocksMovement` for `HubCollision`. `test/biomes/hub/HubModelTest.hx` (every case column-specific) was replaced by `HubStructureTest`/`MazeShrineTest`/`TowerReplicaTest`, covering the local-frame math and each structure's own pure collision/painting-placement queries — not `build`'s own scene/rendering side, same split this project's tests already keep everywhere else.

Verified in-browser via the established temp-debug-spawn technique: both structures render with correct texture/height, teleporting onto either painting's own trigger position warps into the right biome with no jump needed, and the tower's return-spawn path lands the player facing its ground-level painting.

## 2026-07-18 — Both landmarks, tripled

hooman, after seeing the above: "the idea is there, but the shrine and tower are still much too small... make them thrice bigger." `MazeShrine.ARM_UNIT` (`2.4`→`7.2`) and `TowerReplica.OUTER_RADIUS`/`FLOOR_HEIGHT`/`LEDGE_PROTRUSION`/`LEDGE_HEIGHT` (all ×3) scale the footprint; `GridMesh.WALL_HEIGHT` stays untouched on the shrine, per the original ask that it match the real maze's own wall height regardless of the shrine's own footprint.

**Naively tripling `TowerReplica.PAINTING_HALF_ANGLE` alongside `OUTER_RADIUS` would have reintroduced the same-session sagitta bug it had just been fixed for.** Chord length scales linearly with radius at a fixed angle, but so does the arc's own sagitta (`radius * (1 - cos(angle))`) — tripling the radius while keeping the angle fixed keeps the same *visual* proportions but also triples the bulge past `SURFACE_INSET` right back out (`22.5 * (1 - cos(0.2)) = 0.45`, past `0.4` again). Re-derived instead of reused: `0.14` at the new `22.5` radius keeps the sagitta (`0.22`) comfortably under `SURFACE_INSET`, trading some of the original fix's own safety margin for a wider, better-proportioned painting on the now much bigger spire.

Verified in-browser (temp-debug-spawn again, standing back far enough this time to fit each structure's own now-much-bigger footprint in frame): both read as substantially more imposing landmarks, the shrine's spiral and the tower's belt-course ledges both clearly legible from a distance.

## 2026-07-18 — Shrine walls given real thickness; the tower's own painting was nearly unreachable

Two more direct reports once the tripled versions were actually walked through: the shrine's walls "are 2D. I'd rather they be 3D like the maze itself," and the tower had "invisible obstacle (or messed up hitboxes or something) around it. It is extra hard reaching the painting, which does not warp the player anyways."

**The shrine's walls really were flat.** `MazeShrine.build` drew one single-sided quad per wall segment — visible from both sides only because `culling = None`, not because there was any actual volume there, unlike the real maze's own walls (`biomes.common.grid.GridMesh.WallBuilder`: inner face, top cap, end caps, real `GridGeometry.WALL_THICKNESS`). Rewritten as a real box per segment (`addWallBox`): inner face, outer face, top cap, and end caps, at the same `WALL_THICKNESS` the real maze uses. Each segment extends its own two ends by half that thickness before offsetting perpendicular to its own length — a simpler stand-in for `GridMesh`'s own per-cell mitred corners, good enough here since consecutive walls only ever meet at a plain 90-degree turn: the two boxes overlap a little at each turn instead of leaving a gap, invisible either way since both are solid opaque stone. `WALL_CLEARANCE` (collision) followed the real maze's own `wallZoneNeighbor` formula, `WALL_THICKNESS / 2 + COLLISION_CLEARANCE`, instead of an arbitrary flat-quad-era `1.2`. The painting on wall 2 now mounts on its own actual inner face (offset half a thickness off the centerline `wallSegments` returns), not the centerline itself — mounting at the centerline once the wall had real depth would have buried the painting halfway into the stone.

**The tower's own trigger window turned out to be genuinely, geometrically tiny — not a vague "feels off."** Standing exactly on the collision boundary (`OUTER_RADIUS + COLLISION_CLEARANCE`), dead-on with the painting's own fixed angle, clears the painting by only `COLLISION_CLEARANCE` (`1.5`) — comfortably inside `PaintingModel.TRIGGER_DISTANCE` (`4`). But at the tripled `OUTER_RADIUS` (`22.5`), straying off that one exact angle grows the straight-line distance to the painting fast: worked out the actual window is only about **9 degrees** wide. Everywhere else on the boundary reads as exactly what got reported — an invisible wall that never lets the player close enough to trigger anything. The fix is exactly what was asked for, and for the right reason: shrinking `OUTER_RADIUS` while holding `COLLISION_CLEARANCE` fixed widens that window since the fixed gap matters relative to the radius it's measured against, not in absolute terms — at the new `OUTER_RADIUS` (`10`), the same math gives roughly **20 degrees**. `FLOOR_HEIGHT` raised `10.5`→`13` per the same ask ("a bit higher, with more space between levels so the painting has more space as well") — taller, thinner proportions than the tripled version, not a reversion to it. `PAINTING_HALF_ANGLE` re-derived again for the new radius (`0.2`, sagitta `0.20`) — same sagitta-vs-`SURFACE_INSET` reasoning as every previous radius change, not something that gets to be skipped just because this radius happens to be shrinking rather than growing.

Verified in-browser: the shrine's walls show real thickness at their own corners now, and teleporting onto the tower's own painting trigger position warps into the real tower reliably.

## 2026-07-19 — The backlog's own hourglass, built as a third hub landmark

`docs/open/ideas-backlog.md`'s backlog had an unimplemented "Hourglass game-speed control (hub)" entry, flagged unproven ("unclear yet what tilting it should actually affect... whether it's fun rather than just a novelty"). hooman asked for it directly: a tiltable hourglass on a pedestal, tilting right when walked up to from the left (and vice versa), fake white/blue sand mostly pooled at the top with a little at the bottom and a flowing-down effect, reversing that flow and snapping back to normal speed if slowed enough, and — read as its own pair of facts about the tilt itself, not the player's side — "on the left, it will slow the game; on the right, it will accelerate it."

**New `biomes.hub.HourglassModel`/`Hourglass`**, split the same way `docs/rules/guidelines.md` §1.4/§5.4 already splits every other biome object: `HourglassModel` is pure tilt/sand/time-scale state (unit-tested, `HourglassModelTest`), `Hourglass` is the scene-graph build plus the pure `blocksMovement`/`lean` queries (`HourglassTest`, same split `MazeShrine`/`TowerReplica` already use). Anchored via `HubStructure` like the other two landmarks, but *not* at one of their 120-degree slots — it isn't a to-biome portal needing even spacing, so it sits directly ahead of the fixed spawn point instead (`HubBiome.HOURGLASS_THETA`), somewhere worth seeing on arrival.

**Rebuilt every tick rather than animated via scene-graph transforms or a shader.** `GrassWind`'s own precedent (a shader-driven sway) would have meant a bespoke rotate-around-an-arbitrary-world-axis vertex shader just for one small object; instead `Hourglass.buildDynamic` reuses this project's existing "build geometry from world-space points off a local frame" style (`HubStructure.worldPoint`), fed a *tilted* copy of the basis (`tiltedBasis`, rotating `up`/`uAxis` around `vAxis` by the current tilt via `SphereMath.rotateAroundAxis`) each tick. Cheap enough at this triangle count, and reads far more consistently with `MazeShrine`/`TowerReplica` than a new shader would have.

**The game-speed effect needed a real hook into `game.GameLoop`, not a downcast.** `biomes.common.Biome`'s own class doc is explicit that `GameLoop` only ever talks to whichever biome is current through the interface, never by type name — so two new interface methods, `tick(player, dt)` (advances any per-tick state a biome owns beyond movement/gravity — today, only the hub's hourglass) and `timeScale()` (the game-speed multiplier that biome currently wants, `1` for every biome but the hub). `MazeBiome`/`TowerBiome`/the test suite's own `StubBiome` all got trivial no-op implementations. `GameLoop.fixedUpdate` now calls `currentBiome.tick` first (real, unscaled `dt`), reads `timeScale()`, and applies the result to every movement/turn/gravity `dt` that same tick — not to the jump impulse itself (a rate, not a distance; its effect already scales through the gravity integration that follows) and not to mouse-look (aim responsiveness staying constant regardless of time scale is the more standard feel).

**Resolving "on the left it slows, on the right it accelerates" against the sentence right before it** ("tilts right when walked up to from the left, and vice versa") was a real ambiguity: does "left"/"right" in the second sentence mean the *player's* side, or the *tilt's* own direction? Read as two independent, sequential facts about the object itself (tilt-left → slow, tilt-right → accelerate) rather than chaining through the player's side, which is what `HourglassModel.timeScale` implements — the indirect consequence (approaching from the left tilts it right, which *accelerates* the game, not slows it) reads a little unintuitive stated baldly, but it's what the text says taken at face value, and nothing about "which of the two readings is actually more fun" is answerable without playtesting anyway (this is still exactly the unproven prototype the backlog entry always was).

**The reverse-and-reset is a self-correcting safety valve, not the real mechanic yet** — tilt it far enough left for long enough (`HourglassModel.reversing`) and it forces its own tilt back to neutral while the sand visibly drains backward, then resumes normal speed. Deliberately driven by real `dt`, never by the `timeScale()` it itself produces (a self-referential scale would be a feedback loop — the hourglass slowing down its own rate as it slows the game). The "reverse the animation" visual costs no extra flag at all: the stream's grain positions are already a function of `sandPhase` advancing forward; letting `sandPhase` itself run backward while reversing makes the grains cycle the other way for free. Per the ask, this reversal is meant to eventually read as "time is flowing backward" and gate a real mechanic elsewhere — logged as its own new backlog entry in `docs/open/ideas-backlog.md`, not built here.

Verified: `make check`/`make test` clean (`HourglassModelTest`/`HourglassTest` both fully green), `make fmt`/`make lint` clean (info-level noise only, same as every other file in this project).

## 2026-07-19 — Return spawns face away, not back; the tower's painting bends around the wall

Two direct follow-ups after playing with the redesigned hub. First: "when we enter through a painting, I'd like to face the opposite direction when exiting the other painting." `MazeShrine.returnSpawn`/`TowerReplica.returnSpawn` both faced the returning player back toward the structure they'd just come out of — the same direction walking into the original painting itself points, since that walk is a walk further into the shrine/spire. Facing that way again on arrival had the player immediately retracing their own steps rather than continuing out into the open hub, the way walking through an ordinary doorway keeps you moving forward on the other side. Both flipped to face outward (`outOfSpiral`/`outOfSpire`, the mirror of the removed `intoSpiral`/`intoSpire`) — position unchanged, only which way the player's own back is turned.

Second: "can we make the tower painting in the hub keep the same resolution, but bend along the tower?" `TowerReplica`'s own painting was still a flat `PaintingModel.buildQuad`, inset off a chord across the spire's curved wall — visually flat against a wall that's visibly round, even after `PAINTING_HALF_ANGLE`'s own earlier fix kept the resulting sagitta gap small enough not to show as a broken seam. New `PaintingModel.buildArcQuad` (plus arc-shaped `buildArcFrame`/`buildArcOutline`/`addArcBand` mirroring the existing flat `buildFrame`/`buildOutline`/`addRingBand` trio) sweeps the artwork across `segments` flat facets following the wall's own circle instead of a single chord — continuous `0`-to-`1` UV across the whole arc, same as the flat version, so the image reads at the same size, not stretched, shrunk, or tiled differently, just bent to fit. No `roomCenter`/`imageUpMatchesUp` parameters unlike `buildQuad`: mounted on the *outside* of a solid convex cylinder, "which way is outward" is never ambiguous the way an arbitrary flat wall's can be. `PAINTING_HALF_ANGLE` itself stayed at `0.2` even though curving the artwork removes the sagitta constraint that value was originally chosen for — changing it now would resize the painting, outside what was actually asked.

Both fixes landed while another concurrent session was actively building the hourglass above — coordinated by keeping to files that session wasn't touching (`MazeShrine.hx`/`TowerReplica.hx`/`PaintingModel.hx`/their tests) and re-deriving one lost edit (a `HubBiome.hx` doc-comment update, clobbered by a save race) by hand rather than forcing a stash merge across genuinely concurrent changes to the same file.

## 2026-07-19 — The curved painting's own aspect ratio was still wrong

Direct follow-up on the curving fix above: "the painting's resolution is messed up... its height looks fine, but its width is much too small." Not a rendering bug in `buildArcQuad` itself — the aspect ratio was wrong going in. `PAINTING_HALF_ANGLE` (`0.2`) was left untouched by the curving change specifically because widening it "wasn't part of that ask" at the time, but that constant is what actually sets the painting's own width (`PaintingModel.WIDTH_FRACTION` applied to the wall-mount arc); the painting's height comes entirely from `fillWall(FLOOR_HEIGHT)`, unrelated to it. With the tower's own current `OUTER_RADIUS` (`10`) and `FLOOR_HEIGHT` (`13`), `0.2` produced a painting about **3 times taller than it is wide** — a tall slit, not a picture, just never actually re-derived once the sagitta constraint that originally chose it stopped applying.

Since curving removed that constraint entirely (see the entry above), there was no reason left not to widen it for its own sake. `0.45` targets a painting roughly as wide as it is tall — worked out directly from the same numbers (`fillWall`'s own resulting height, `WIDTH_FRACTION`, `OUTER_RADIUS`), not carried over from a value chosen for an unrelated reason. `PAINTING_ARC_SEGMENTS` went `8`→`12` alongside it so each facet still spans roughly the same small angle at the new, wider span. Verified in-browser: the painting now reads as a normal picture, still following the tower's own curve.

## 2026-07-19 — The tower's own fall counter, and a guaranteed tile at the entrance

`docs/open/ideas-backlog.md`'s backlog had an unimplemented "Falls counter" entry: every distinct layer the player stands on in the tower should count once, cueing the player toward threading gaps rather than landing on every floor — precision, not speed. Built the counter and its diegetic cue (no HUD number, per this project's "Diegetic over UI chrome" pillar); the actual "reach bottom with the smallest count to unlock something" objective stays in the backlog, unbuilt.

**`TowerBiome` gained `touchedLayers`/`fallCount`** alongside the existing `deepestLayerReached` — a different running value, not a replacement: `deepestLayerReached` only cares about the deepest point ever reached, while `fallCount` counts *distinct* landings, so re-landing on an already-touched layer (walking back over solid ground, or a jump that lands back where it started) never double-counts. Both reset together in `spawnPlayer`. Detecting an actual landing (not just "currently grounded") needed an edge check in `applyGravity` — `player.grounded` stays `true` for every tick spent resting on a floor, so only the tick where it flips `false → true` is a new landing; without that, resting in place would recount the same layer every single fixed step.

**The glow cue went through two iterations.** First pass mixed a flat warning-red tint uniformly across the whole floor/wall texture, strength scaling with `fallCount` (`TowerModel.fallGlowIntensity`, linear against `GOAL_LEVELS`, first-pass numbers) via two new `UnlitTexture` shader params (`tintColor`/`tintAmount`, defaulting to a no-op so the shader's ten-odd other call sites — `HubMesh`, `Hourglass`, `PaintingModel`, … — render unchanged). Reported directly as "oppressive" once actually seen in-browser: a flat color swap over the entire tile reads as the room itself changing color, not as a warning cue layered on top of it. Fixed by masking the tint by the sampled texel's own darkness (`smoothstep` over luminance, `0.15`–`0.35`) rather than applying it uniformly — every stone/brick texture this project has drawn so far puts its darkest pixels along the mortar joints/tile seams, so a darkness-weighted mix reads as the *seams* glowing instead of the whole tile recoloring, confirmed in-browser at full intensity (only the joint lines actually turn red, the brick/tile faces stay their normal color). Still a no-op at `tintAmount = 0` regardless of the mask, so this cost every other `UnlitTexture` caller nothing.

**Second follow-up, same session: "when we get into the tower from the painting, we spawn in the middle... I'd rather we spawned on a tile forced to exist right next to the painting."** `TowerBiome.spawnPlayer` always placed the player at the top layer's own always-solid center disk, `PAINTING_ANGLE` away from wherever the layout actually generated a floor near the entrance wall — a fresh arrival had no guarantee of solid ground until they'd already walked blind toward it. Rather than moving the painting, forced the specific outer-ring tile the painting sits in front of (`TowerModel.entranceTileRing`/`entranceTileIndex`, computed off `PAINTING_ANGLE` the same way `paintingWallEdge` already is) solid at layer 0 in `TowerGenerator.generate`, same "force this one spot regardless of the random roll" treatment the bottom layer's own guaranteed floor already gets. `spawnPlayer` now stands the player at that tile's own center (`TowerModel.entranceSpawnPosition`), facing inward (`entranceSpawnForward`) — away from the entrance wall, not back toward the painting just stepped out of, same "keep moving forward through the doorway" reasoning `biomes.hub.TowerReplica.returnSpawn`'s own doc already lays out for the opposite direction.

Verified in-browser (temp-debug-spawn into the tower directly): a fresh arrival now stands on real floor facing the shaft's open interior instead of the center disk; cranking `fallGlowIntensity` to a temporary max confirmed only the mortar seams glow, not the whole tile. `make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean, new coverage in `TowerModelTest`/`TowerGeneratorTest` for the entrance-tile forcing and spawn placement.

## 2026-07-19 — The seam glow still read as the whole room reddening

The seam-masked glow above was still "too red" once seen at scale in-browser: "the whole atmosphere in the tower becomes too red." Mortar joints thread through effectively the entire floor/wall surface, so even though only the *darkest* pixels were tinting, that was still practically every seam in view — restricting *which pixels* light up didn't restrict *how much of the room* looks affected, since seams are everywhere. hooman's own framing pointed at the actual fix: "try with only a few bricks becoming redder."

Replaced the darkness mask with a coarse per-cell selection: `UnlitTexture.fragment` now buckets `calculatedUV` into a grid (`glowCellSize`, a new per-instance param — see below), hashes each cell's own integer coordinate through a fixed GLSL "poor man's noise" (`fract(sin(dot(cell, ...)) * ...)`), and only mixes in `tintColor` for cells whose hash falls under `tintAmount * 0.12` — so at most ~12% of cells can ever glow, each at a fixed `0.65` mix strength (only the *count* of glowing cells grows with `tintAmount`, not how strongly any single one glows). Confirmed in-browser at a temporary max intensity: scattered individual brick/paving-stone-sized patches light up, most of the surface stays untouched — reading as "a few bricks," not the room's own atmosphere shifting.

**`glowCellSize` had to become a real per-instance param, not a shared constant** — `TowerMesh`'s floor and wall meshes' UVs mean wildly different things: the wall's tiles normally (`addWallQuad`, one UV unit per `MeshBuilder.WALL_TEXTURE_TILE_SIZE` world units), while the floor is one absolute-position medallion decal spanning the *entire* floor in a single `[0, 1]` UV range (`floorUv`, no tiling at all — see `TowerMesh`'s own class doc). A single shared cell-per-UV-unit constant, tried first, made the wall's dots read as roughly brick-sized but the floor's read as whole ring-wedges — much too coarse. `TowerMesh` now passes its own tuned `FLOOR_GLOW_CELL_SIZE` (`0.025`) and `WALL_GLOW_CELL_SIZE` (`0.125`) into each shader instance's constructor; `UnlitTexture`'s own default (`0.1`) is irrelevant to every other caller, all of which leave `tintAmount` at `0`.

Also discovered mid-fix: hxsl's `SRC` shader-source macro block can't see ordinary Haxe static class fields — an initial attempt to name the grid density/cap/strength constants as `static inline final`s failed to compile ("Unknown identifier"), even though they're perfectly ordinary `inline` fields anywhere else in this codebase. All three now live as commented literals directly inside `fragment` instead.

## 2026-07-19 — The glow leaked into the maze, and didn't match the brick pattern anyway

Two more direct reports on the coarse-grid version above. First, a screenshot of the *maze* (not the tower) showing stray white rectangles scattered across its walls: "This has screwed up the maze as well. I'd like the change to only apply to the tower." Second, on the tower itself: "this doesn't match the bricks pattern at all" — the coarse grid's own cell boundaries don't correspond to anything in the actual baked brick/paving-stone art, so a "lit" cell showed as a flat rectangle floating across (and sometimes straddling) real bricks and mortar joints alike, not any specific brick actually reddening.

**The leak's root cause was structural, not a tuning miss:** the previous round folded the whole glow (grid hash, threshold, mix) directly into `UnlitTexture.fragment` — the one shader `HubMesh`, `Hourglass`, `PaintingModel`, `GridMesh`, and everything else in the project shares. `tintAmount` defaulting to `0` was supposed to make this a no-op everywhere but the tower, and mathematically it is (`step(cellRandom, 0)` needs `cellRandom` to land exactly on `0`) — but GPU float precision on the classic `sin`/`fract` hash trick isn't perfectly uniform, and evidently lands exactly (or near enough) on the threshold often enough to show up as visible stray patches on completely unrelated meshes. Splitting the effect into its own shader, **`graphics.shaders.SparseTint`**, added only to `TowerMesh`'s two meshes (as a second shader in the same pass, reading and rewriting whatever `UnlitTexture` already wrote to `output.color` — the same "shaders concatenate in shader-list order" mechanism `GrassWind`'s own class doc documents), makes this structurally impossible regardless of any future precision quirk: nothing outside `TowerMesh` ever attaches it. `UnlitTexture` itself reverted to exactly its pre-glow form.

**The shape-fidelity complaint needed combining, not replacing, the last two attempts' own ideas** — the coarse grid solved *sparseness* (only a few cells ever lit) but had no relationship to the real art; the darkness mask two rounds ago solved *shape fidelity* (only real mortar-joint pixels ever tinted) but covered the whole surface since joints are everywhere. `SparseTint.fragment` now does both together: the coarse per-cell hash decides *whether* a cell is even eligible to glow at all (at most `20%` of cells, tightened up from the previous round's outright glow-strength cap since the darkness mask itself now cuts down the lit area further within an eligible cell), and only *within* an eligible cell does the darkness mask (`smoothstep` over `output.color`'s own sampled luminance) pick which pixels actually tint — real seams, not a rectangle. Confirmed in-browser: individual brick outlines visibly glow within a handful of scattered patches, no floating rectangles, and the maze renders with no stray patches at all.

`make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean.

## 2026-07-19 — Patches grow from a seed brick instead of popping in at random

Still not quite right per direct feedback: "not there yet. Can we match precisely the bricks?... I'd rather have the glow cover precisely one brick in each patch at first, then grow to a few, then a few more, and so on, in random directions. Also... the tint to be more discreet. Less catchy. Dimmer, perhaps." Two asks: real per-brick precision (a lit patch should be *made of* real bricks, edge-to-edge, not seams or an arbitrary cell), and a growth animation over the fall counter's own range rather than a fixed sparse pattern that's either present or absent per cell.

**Brick precision meant inverting the mask, not just aligning the grid.** The previous round's darkness mask picked out *mortar* (the sampled texel's darkest pixels) — correct for making the previous "seams glow" version hug the real art, wrong for "cover precisely one brick," which wants the *face* lit, mortar excluded. `SparseTint.fragment` now does `smoothstep(0.15, 0.35, luminance)` directly (no `1.0 -`) — the brightness band real brick/paving-stone faces sit in, rather than its complement.

**The growth animation replaced the flat per-cell eligibility roll with a distance-to-seed check.** Each coarse cluster (10×10 bricks, a fixed, `intensity`-independent `15%` of clusters ever having a patch at all — *where* patches exist stays constant, only *how far grown* changes) gets one pseudo-random seed brick, floored to a whole cell so it's always at exactly distance `0` from itself — without that floor, a patch could fail to show *any* brick at low `intensity` if the raw (fractional) seed position happened to sit far enough from every whole brick cell's own center. `growRadius = intensity * 4.0` (in brick units) grows from `0` (exactly the seed's own brick, and nothing else) up to `4` bricks out at `intensity = 1`; a fragment's own brick lights up (subject to the face mask above) if its distance to its cluster's seed is within `growRadius`. Growing a circular radius outward reads as "in random directions" the way it's actually achievable per-fragment (no wind/directional bias, expanding into whichever neighboring bricks the radius reaches, not a single preferred axis).

**Deliberately not exact Worley/cellular noise** — each brick only ever measures distance to its *own* cluster's seed, never checking neighboring clusters for a closer one, so a patch can in principle clip at a cluster boundary rather than tapering naturally if its seed sits right at that edge. Accepted as a first-pass approximation since `MAX_GROW_RADIUS` (4) stays well under half the cluster size (10), making the edge case rare in practice — noted in `SparseTint`'s own class doc as the thing to revisit (a real 3×3-neighbor search) if it ever reads as a visible hard edge.

**Dimmer, per both asks together:** `GLOW_MIX_STRENGTH` dropped `0.65` → `0.35`, and `Colours.TOWER_FALL_GLOW` itself darkened/desaturated from a bright warning red (`0xFFB2302A`) to a muted brick-red (`0xFF6E2B26`) — the brightness that read fine confined to thin seam lines read as "too catchy" once filling whole brick faces instead.

Verified in-browser at three intensities (temporary overrides, same technique as every prior round): near-zero (realistic `fallCount = 1`) shows a faint, easy-to-miss discoloration on a couple of individual bricks; a mid-range value shows small, clearly brick-bounded clusters; a maxed-out value shows larger but still contained clusters, never the whole wall. `make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean.

`make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean (no test changes — this round is pure shader/visual tuning, nothing pure-logic to cover beyond what `TowerModelTest`/`TowerGeneratorTest` already exercise).

## 2026-07-19 — The shrine's walls blocked from the opposite side of the sphere; now climbable

Reported directly: "the maze shrine's walls' hitbox is too high. On the opposite side of the sphere, you still get blocked by the walls hitbox — instead of confining it to the walls themselves. Limit their height, and make sure the top part of the wall has a hitbox too, so the player can jump and walk on a wall."

**Root cause: `HubStructure.localUV` only ever returned `(u, v)`, never height, and every structure's own `blocksMovement` only ever checked that `(u, v)` against a flat local footprint.** Worked out precisely why "opposite side of the sphere" specifically: the point diametrically opposite a structure's own anchor has a displacement from that anchor that's purely radial — and radial is exactly what `uAxis`/`vAxis` are perpendicular to by construction — so it projects to local `(u, v) = (0, 0)` *exactly*, indistinguishable from standing right on top of the structure, regardless of the structure's own position or size. `localUV` now also returns `height` (the same displacement dotted with `basis.up`) — `0`-ish for any point actually near the structure, `2 * radius` at the antipode — and `MazeShrine`/`TowerReplica`/`Hourglass` (`blocksMovement`, and `Hourglass.lean`, same bug) all reject a query outright once `height` exceeds a generous per-structure sanity bound, before ever looking at `(u, v)`. Regression-tested directly: a real point on the real sphere (`SphereMath.sphericalToCartesian(radius, pi - theta, phi + pi)`), not merely a flat far-away offset the old tests already covered.

**The wall-height limit ran straight into this project's own jump physics.** Bounding `MazeShrine.blocksMovement` to `[0, WALL_HEIGHT]` (so a player above a wall's own top isn't blocked sideways by it) is only half of "walk on a wall" — reaching the top by jumping is the other half, and `game.GameLoop.JUMP_IMPULSE`/hub `GRAVITY` cap a jump at `impulse² / (2 × gravity) ≈ 2.7` units, far short of the real maze's own `GridMesh.WALL_HEIGHT` (`12`) this landmark's walls used to match. Presented with that gap directly, hooman chose to shrink the shrine's own walls (a new, shrine-only `MazeShrine.WALL_HEIGHT = 2`) rather than raise the shared jump impulse (which would've changed jump feel everywhere, maze and tower included) or ship the collision fix alone without real reachability.

**Wiring "stand on top" needed a real per-position ground height, which the hub never had.** `biomes.common.Gravity.fallToSurface` (shared by the hub and the real maze — "floor is present everywhere") always clamped straight to `0`; gained an optional `groundHeight` parameter (default `0`, so the maze's own call site is untouched) instead. New `MazeShrine.wallTopHeightAt(basis, worldPos):Null<Float>` — the same horizontal footprint check `blocksMovement` uses, queried from above rather than the side — returns `WALL_HEIGHT` over a wall, `null` elsewhere. `HubBiome.applyGravity` now computes this fresh every tick and passes it straight through, so landing on a wall's top holds the player there, and walking off its edge falls them back to the floor exactly the same way falling off any ledge would. `HubCollision.tryMove` passes `player.airborneHeight` into `MazeShrine.blocksMovement` now too, so a player already above `WALL_HEIGHT` (having actually jumped up) can walk across the top freely, while anyone below it still can't walk through the wall's own body to get there — has to jump.

Incidental find while wiring test coverage: `HourglassTest`/`HourglassModelTest` existed as files but were never registered in `test/TestMain.hx`'s runner at all — neither had ever actually executed under `make test`, cleanly passing tests or not notwithstanding. Added both (with the new antipodal regression cases) alongside this fix.

`make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean. Not yet verified in-browser: reaching the shrine requires walking there interactively, which this session's own tooling can't reliably drive (see this project's own `CLAUDE.md`, updated this session) — asked hooman to check directly instead.

## 2026-07-19 — The tower's glow was banding at one height; root cause was the wall's own UV, not the shader

While waiting on the shrine fix above, a screenshot of the tower's own fall-counter glow: "the glow only happens on one level, it's not all over the tower anymore, and still not well adjusted." Reachable from the fixed tower spawn point without interactive movement, so — per this same session's own new rule about not driving movement itself — this one *was* run down directly, via the temp-debug-spawn/cranked-intensity technique every prior round already used.

**First hypothesis, and a real fix, but not the actual bug:** `clusterCell.y` climbs into the hundreds across the tower's own full height, and `sin()` of a dot product that large can degrade badly at the `mediump` float precision fragment shaders commonly run at (relative precision ~1/1024 becomes a large absolute error once the value itself is in the thousands). Wrapped every hash's own input (`mod(clusterCell, 256.0)`) before it reaches `sin()` as a defensive fix — cheap, correct in principle, kept in the end — but rebuilding and checking still showed the exact same banding. Wrong tree.

**Found the real cause by instrumenting the live WebGL context directly**, since the shader *looked* right on inspection and doc-reasoning alone wasn't settling it: hooked `gl.shaderSource` to confirm the compiled fragment shader matched the source exactly, hooked `useProgram`/`drawElements` to confirm that exact program was genuinely bound for real draw calls (not some stale, unused leftover), and read back its actual bound uniforms (`intensity = 1`, `cellSizeU`/`cellSizeV` both correct) — everything checked out, which meant the bug had to be upstream, in what UV coordinates the mesh itself was actually feeding the shader. Swapped the shader's own output to a raw debug visualization (`clusterHash` as grayscale) and got the answer immediately: broad uniform gray with sharp periodic white dashes at regular intervals — structured aliasing, not noise.

**Root cause: `TowerMesh.addOuterWall` built its cylindrical wall from 32 independent quads, each restarting its own texture U back at `0`** (`addWallQuad`'s own per-quad UV convention, unchanged since long before the glow feature existed) — harmless for the plain repeating brick texture itself (tiles fine either way, texture `wrap = Repeat`), but it meant `SparseTint`'s own cluster grid saw the *identical* narrow slice of `(u, v)` values 32 times over — each wall segment barely wider than one cluster — rather than the wall's full circumference. Fixed by threading a running `uOffset` through `addWallQuad` (a new, defaulted-to-`0` parameter, so every other caller — relief walls, radial end caps — is unaffected) so `addOuterWall` gives its own 32 segments one continuous coordinate around the whole cylinder instead of each restarting at `0`.

Confirmed by re-running the exact same cranked-density visual test as every prior round: patches now scatter properly across the wall's full width, no more banding.

`make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean.

## 2026-07-19 — Individual bricks could still show a hard, misaligned split

Direct follow-up with three close-up screenshots: "Better, but not there yet! The alignment is still faulty." Visible in the screenshots: single bricks half-tinted, with the boundary between tinted and untinted cutting across the middle of a real brick rather than following its own mortar edge — not the "floating rectangle" shape from two rounds ago, a narrower but still real misalignment.

**Root cause this time was in the source art and this wall's own geometry, not a logic bug**: measured `tower_stone_wall.png`'s actual brick pitch precisely (34×22 pixels in its 256×256 image, mortar joints found by scanning raw pixel data) to confirm the running-bond stagger is exactly half a brick (`17px` shift row-to-row, confirmed via multiple rows) — that part was already exactly right. The real issue: `256 / 34 ≈ 7.53` — not a whole number of bricks per texture tile — so the art's own seamless wrap (real, confirmed by eye) necessarily isn't a perfectly uniform brick repeat at its own tile edge; separately, this wall's own `uOffset` per segment (`TowerMesh.addOuterWall`, added the round above) isn't a whole number of cells wide either. Both mean the nominal nominal `brickCell` grid can drift a fraction of a cell out of phase with the real art at those specific seams — rare (once every several bricks), but exactly there, a single real brick can straddle two different nominal cells, one part of an active patch and one not.

**Not fixable by chasing exact alignment** (would need either regenerating the texture at a whole brick count, or a real per-brick ID mask — both real content/engineering investments, not a quick parameter tune) — instead added `cellInset`, fading the tint out over the outer 25% of each nominal cell's own width and height before it's ever applied, so a small nominal/real drift lands inside the already-faded margin instead of ever showing as a hard, misplaced cut. Costs a very slightly smaller lit area per brick (imperceptible at normal viewing distance) in exchange for never visibly splitting one.

Verified by temporarily forcing every cell active (`clusterActive = 1`, `growRadius = 1000`) to decouple "is the inset/alignment correct" from "did a real patch happen to land here" — every visible brick showed a single, cleanly-inset rectangle sitting well inside its own real edges, no half-brick splits anywhere across a wide sampled section of wall (multiple viewing angles, via the temp-facing-offset technique). `make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean.

## 2026-07-19 — The fall-counter glow, rebuilt on real geometry instead of brick art

Even the inset fix above wasn't enough: "No, it's still not close enough to being properly aligned." Five rounds deep chasing alignment against `tower_stone_wall.png`'s own baked brick art (seam mask, brightness mask, growth radius, running-bond stagger, UV continuity, cell inset), asked directly for a fundamentally different approach: "What other options could we have?" Recommended dropping brick-tinting entirely for something that doesn't need to align to any texture at all. hooman picked a specific variation: "make the edges of the tiles glow slightly (no colour, emit white light)... start dim, only the edges of the inner circle... grow in both intensity and length (reach further rings)" as the fall counter's own *percentage* (not raw count) climbs — also naming the actual reason a percentage: three future thresholds (touch only the top/bottom floors, touch every floor, anything in between) will each unlock something different, not implemented yet.

**This sidesteps the entire alignment problem by construction, not by another mitigation**: `TowerModel`'s own ring boundaries (`CENTER_DISK_RADIUS`, `ringWidth()`) are exact, known world-space radii — a fragment's own distance from the shaft's central axis compared against those radii is *exact* geometry, never an approximated texture-grid guess the way a brick count ever was. New `graphics.shaders.TileRingGlow`: additive white (no `tintColor` at all), computes world position back out of the floor's own existing decal UV (`TowerMesh.floorUv`'s own inverse — no second UV channel needed), and hand-unrolls a check against all 5 ring boundaries (`RINGS_PER_LAYER + 1`) since hxsl's `SRC` block doesn't support a dynamically-bounded loop. Per-boundary strength is `clamp(intensity * 5 - boundaryIndex, 0, 1)` — boundary `0` (the center disk's own rim) reaches full brightness first, then boundary `1` starts climbing, and so on outward, exactly the "start dim, only the inner circle, then grow in intensity and reach" progression asked for.

**`SparseTint` (and everything built to prop it up) is gone entirely**: deleted the shader, reverted `TowerMesh`'s wall-splitting and `addWallQuad`'s `uOffset` threading (both existed solely to fix `SparseTint`'s own bugs, moot once nothing tints the wall at all — back to a single combined wall mesh, no glow shader on it), removed `Colours.TOWER_FALL_GLOW` (no color left to name). `TowerMesh.build`'s own return type (`TowerVisuals`) now carries `floorGlow:TileRingGlow` instead of `wallGlow:SparseTint`; `TowerBiome`'s own wiring (`markTouched` → `TowerMesh.setFallGlow`) is otherwise unchanged, since `TowerModel.fallGlowIntensity` was already exactly "percent of floors touched" from the very first round — only what consumes that number changed.

Verified in-browser at both extremes (temp-debug-spawn, temp-maxed `fallGlowIntensity`, same technique as every prior round): near-zero shows a faint, easy-to-miss brightening right at the center disk's own rim and nothing further out; maxed-out shows clean, bright white circles at multiple ring boundaries, sharply circular with no texture-alignment artifacts anywhere, since there's no texture involved in deciding where the glow sits at all. `make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean — no test changes, this round is pure shader/visual rework with nothing new to unit-test beyond what already covers `TowerModel`'s own ring geometry.

## 2026-07-19 — Radial tile seams glow too; the shrine's shorter walls were sinking into tall grass

Two more direct reports, unrelated to each other. First, on the ring glow above: "Can you make it on the all of the tiles side? Not only the rings edges" — the 5 concentric ring-boundary circles glowed, but each ring's own tile-to-tile (radial) seams didn't. Second, a screenshot of the maze shrine landmark in the hub: its walls barely poked above the surrounding grass, reading as sunk into the ground.

**Radial seams**: each ring's own tile count and angular shear are fixed by this project's own structural constants (`TowerModel.BASE_TILES_PER_RING`, `RING_ANGLE_STEP_SLOTS`, `ANGULAR_SEGMENTS`), never the randomly generated layout — so, same reasoning as the ring boundaries themselves, exact geometry, not a texture guess. hxsl can't call into ordinary Haxe (`TowerModel.tilesForRing`/`ringAngleOffset`), so `TileRingGlow.fragment` hand-computes each of the 4 rings' own tile angular width and angle offset as literal constants (derived directly from those same formulas, commented inline) and, for whichever ring `radius` currently falls in, checks the fragment's own angle (`atan(worldZ, worldX)`, same convention `TowerModel.slotAt` itself already uses) against that ring's own periodic tile-boundary spacing. A ring's radial seams share its own inner boundary circle's strength (`boundary0` drives ring 0's seams, etc.), so a ring's interior detail appears exactly when that ring itself has been "reached," not on a separate schedule. Confirmed in-browser (same temp-maxed-intensity technique): radial spokes now visibly fan out from the center disk alongside the ring circles.

**The shrine's grass**: root cause was the wall-height fix two rounds ago — shrinking `MazeShrine.WALL_HEIGHT` to `2` (for climbability) put it well under `GrassModel.HEIGHT_MAX` (`4`), and the *only* existing grass exclusion (`HubBiome.isWalkable` → `MazeShrine.blocksMovement`) was a thin clearance band hugging each wall's own centerline, leaving most of the spiral's own enclosed interior path fair game for grass tall enough to tower over a 2-unit wall. New `MazeShrine.isWithinFootprint`: an axis-aligned bounding box over the *entire* spiral (computed from every wall segment's own endpoints, `WALL_CLEARANCE` past the farthest on each side) rather than a bounding circle from the local origin — wall 1 sits at the origin but wall 7 reaches tens of units out in one direction only, so a circle wide enough to cover it would clear grass from far more area than the spiral's own square footprint actually occupies. `HubBiome.isWalkable` now checks this instead of `blocksMovement` for the shrine specifically (`blocksMovement` itself, and its own per-wall clearance, is untouched — walking between the arms is still deliberately open, not blocked). Verified in-browser (temp-debug-spawn facing the shrine directly): clear ground now surrounds the whole structure, walls read as standing on bare ground rather than half-buried.

New coverage: `MazeShrineTest` gains cases for `isWithinFootprint` (true at the anchor, true well inside the spiral's own bounding box but clear of every wall — the actual distinction from `blocksMovement` — false well clear of the shrine, false at the antipodal point on the real sphere, same regression class as every other structure query this session). `wallSegments()` briefly went `public` to let a test compute a safe interior point directly, then back to private once a plain hardcoded point (verified by hand against the spiral's own known geometry) covered it just as well — no reason to widen that API surface for one test. `make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean.

## 2026-07-19 — The shrine's grass-clearing reverted; walls made tall instead

Direct, immediate reversal on the round above: "No, I don't like what you did to the shrine. Rollback the grass modification, I liked it better with grass there. Just increase the height of the walls by a good lot, so they are nearly as tall as the camera is high."

Removed `MazeShrine.isWithinFootprint`/`footprintBounds` entirely and put `HubBiome.isWalkable` back to checking `MazeShrine.blocksMovement` directly (its own per-wall clearance band, same as before that round) — grass grows back up to the walls themselves now, no cleared footprint. `WALL_HEIGHT` raised `2` → `5`, close to `entities.player.Camera.EYE_HEIGHT` (`6`) per "nearly as tall as the camera is high." This knowingly re-opens the exact tension the wall-shrinking round existed to resolve — a jump only reaches `≈2.7` units, well short of `5` — but that was the explicit trade hooman asked for this time: presence/scale over climbability. Left the jump-and-stand-on-top collision itself (`blocksMovement`'s own `playerHeight` parameter, `wallTopHeightAt`, `HubBiome.applyGravity`'s own wall-top landing) entirely in place rather than ripping it out — still correct, just unreachable at this height again, and nobody asked for the mechanism itself removed. Removed the now-obsolete `isWithinFootprint` test cases from `MazeShrineTest`.

Verified in-browser (temp-debug-spawn facing the shrine directly, same technique as every prior round): walls read as tall and imposing, camera-eye-height scale, with grass growing naturally right up against them again. `make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean.

## 2026-07-19 — The shrine's walls, doubled again

Direct follow-up: "Better. Make it twice as high." `WALL_HEIGHT` `5` → `10`. Explicitly told to leave the jump-and-stand-on-top collision in place regardless of reachability ("Leave the jump mechanic even if it becomes unreachable. It might be useful later.") — already the plan from the round above, now confirmed as a deliberate, standing choice rather than something to reconsider once the gap between wall height and jump reach (`≈2.7`) grows even wider. Verified in-browser (same temp-debug-spawn technique): the shrine now towers well over the surrounding grass. `make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean.

## 2026-07-19 — Hourglass moved to `entities`, and actually made of glass

Two asks together: "not satisfied with the hourglass" — first, its code has nothing to do in `biomes`; second, make it *look* like an hourglass (dark wood bases, real glass, optionally a metal spiral), with a reference photo attached for the glass/wood/metal look.

**Move**: `Hourglass`/`HourglassModel` relocated from `biomes.hub` to `entities.hourglass`, the same call already made for `entities.painting.PaintingModel` — a self-contained decorative object, not hub-shape-generation code, even though only the hub places one today. It still imports `biomes.hub.HubStructure` for the local tangent-frame it builds against (the one piece of hub-specific machinery it can't avoid depending on) and the same for the two test files (`test/entities/hourglass/`). Every call site (`HubBiome`, `HubCollision`), the `Colours`/`Biome` doc-comment cross-references, `test/TestMain.hx`'s runner, and the one live reference in `docs/open/ideas-backlog.md`'s backlog all updated to the new package; `docs/archive/project-log.md`'s own prior entries left alone (history, not a live reference).

**Look**: the previous version had no glass at all — just a flat dark-gray placeholder frame (caps + four corner posts) with sand floating inside it, nothing standing in for the glass envelope itself. Rebuilt as four distinct pieces, all rebuilt fresh every tick alongside the sand (see `Hourglass`'s own class doc for why): `HOURGLASS_WOOD`-colored top/bottom caps (dark brown, replacing the old blue-gray flat fill); an actual glass shell (two mirrored frustums, `GLASS_RIM_RADIUS` at each cap narrowing to a real (non-zero) `GLASS_NECK_RADIUS` at the waist rather than the bulbs meeting at a mathematical point), alpha-blended (`h3d.mat.BlendMode.Alpha`, `depthWrite = false`) at low opacity so the sand/spiral read through it, plus a second, brighter thin-band mesh at the two rims and the neck standing in for a specular glint (this project's flat unlit shading has no real lighting to produce one from — same "traced keyline instead of real relief" discipline `entities.painting.PaintingModel.buildOutline` already uses, brightness instead of a dark line); and a single `HOURGLASS_METAL` ribbon spiraling `SPIRAL_TURNS` times from bottom cap to top, hugging the glass's own profile (`glassRadiusAt`, shared between the glass mesh and the spiral) rather than a fixed cylinder, replacing the old straight corner posts entirely — a real hourglass held together by wire wrap and two wood discs doesn't also need rigid posts. Four new `Colours` entries (`HOURGLASS_WOOD`/`METAL`/`GLASS`/`GLASS_HIGHLIGHT`) replace the retired `HOURGLASS_FRAME`; `HOURGLASS_SAND` untouched.

`make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean (no test changes beyond the relocation — this round is pure package/visual rework, nothing new to unit-test beyond what `HourglassTest`/`HourglassModelTest` already cover). Not verified in-browser: this session's browser preview tool reported a `0×0` `window.innerWidth`/`innerHeight` for this project's page specifically (confirmed independent of this change — a fresh tab hits the same thing) — Heaps sizes its canvas once from that at startup and never revisits it, so the canvas renders at a fixed tiny fallback size regardless of what's actually drawn into it. Asked hooman to check directly instead, per this project's own `CLAUDE.md` note on this tooling's limits.

## 2026-07-19 — Hourglass, round two: thicker/smaller/levitating/slower/perpetual

Five more direct notes on the round above, all at once: thicken the wood bases, shrink the whole thing (same proportions), levitate it further above the pedestal "as if a force field kept it up there," flow slower, and — when the top empties — turn 180° and keep flowing rather than just stopping.

**Size/shape**: new `SCALE = 0.7` constant, multiplied into every size constant below the pedestal (radius, heights, sand/glass/spiral dimensions) at each one's own definition rather than hand-recomputing a single new number per constant — keeps each original, already-tuned value visible right next to its shrink, cheapest to retune again later. `PEDESTAL_RADIUS`/`PEDESTAL_HEIGHT` deliberately excluded — "the whole hourglass" read as the wood/glass/sand assembly itself, not the stone stand it's not part of. New `CAP_THICKNESS`, added onto the wood caps' *outer* faces (`buildCaps` now builds each as a short solid cylinder via a new `addCapBlock`, not a bare disc) rather than eaten out of the glass's own rim plane — `buildGlass`/`buildSand`/`buildSpiral` needed zero changes as a result.

**Levitation**: `tiltedBasis`'s own pivot moves from `PEDESTAL_HEIGHT` to `PEDESTAL_HEIGHT + LEVITATION_HEIGHT` (a new constant, comfortably bigger than `CAP_THICKNESS` so the gap reads clearly under the now-thicker bottom cap) — the pedestal mesh itself (`build`, untilted) doesn't move at all, so this just opens up visible empty space between the two.

**Flow rate**: `HourglassModel.FLOW_RATE` `0.12` → `0.04`, per "flows too fast for something meant to be glanced at."

**Perpetual flip**: the trickiest piece. `HourglassModel` gains `flipped:Bool`, and `tick`'s own normal-flow branch now tracks a local `flowSign` (`+1` normally, `-1` once `flipped`) so `sandPhase` pings between `0` and `1` forever, toggling `flipped` at each end, rather than clamping and stopping. Worked out carefully why a flip *must not* also reset `sandPhase`: `buildSand` always draws "top bulb" (local height near `BULB_HEIGHT * 2`) and "bottom bulb" (near `0`) in the *tilted frame's own* coordinates, and a flip is exactly an extra 180° added to that same frame's own rotation (`Hourglass.tiltedBasis`, reusing the identical `vAxis`-rotation the small left/right lean-tilt already does, just a much bigger angle) — so the instant a flip happens, whichever bulb was physically low (and full, having just finished draining into it) becomes physically high purely from the rotation, with `sandPhase` unchanged. Only then does it make sense for `sandPhase` to start counting back down (`flowSign = -1`): that's what visibly drains the now-physically-high full bulb back into the now-physically-low empty one, the same way flipping a real hourglass over does. Resetting `sandPhase` to `0` at the flip instant instead (the first thing tried, on paper) would have made the sand appear to teleport into the wrong bulb the moment it flipped.

Updated `HourglassModelTest`'s own `testSandPhaseClampsAtOneRatherThanOverflowing` — sustained fast draining now crosses `1` and flips rather than sitting there, so asserting a single fixed endpoint no longer holds; replaced with an invariant check (`sandPhase` never leaves `[0, 1]`) that still holds regardless of how many times it's flipped by the time the loop ends. Added three new cases for the flip cycle itself: reaching `1` sets `flipped` and holds `sandPhase` there (not reset), a tick after that starts draining it back down, and a full round trip clears `flipped` with `sandPhase` back at exactly `0`.

`make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean. Not verified in-browser, same tooling limitation as the round above (confirmed again on a fresh tab against the freshly rebuilt `bin/`) — asked hooman to check directly.

## 2026-07-19 — Tower fall glow: from a line to a halo

Feedback on `graphics.shaders.TileRingGlow` once the ring/radial-seam glow itself was in place: "make the light look more like a light? To cover the tiles seams with some kind of halo, so it looks less texture on texture." Every falloff in the shader (5 ring boundaries, 4 radial tile-seam terms) used `1.0 - smoothstep(0.0, 0.6, d)` — full brightness right at a seam, exactly zero at a fixed `0.6`-unit cutoff. That hard stop is what read as "a line drawn on the texture": no real light's brightness just stops dead at a fixed distance.

Swapped every one of those 9 terms for a Gaussian, `exp(-(d*d) / haloWidthSq)` with `haloWidthSq = 1.96` (i.e. a `1.4`-unit halo width) — same peak brightness exactly on the seam, but the falloff only asymptotes toward zero, spreading the glow softly onto the tile surface on both sides of a seam instead of confining it to a thin band. Bumped `GLOW_MAX_BRIGHTNESS` `0.4` → `0.45` alongside it, since the wider spread reads slightly dimmer at its own peak than the old hard-edged band did at the same nominal brightness.

Verified with the usual static technique: temp-forced `TowerModel.fallGlowIntensity` to a fixed return (`1.0`, then `0.15`) and temp-pointed `GameLoop`'s initial `enterBiome` at `TowerBiome.ID`, rebuilt, screenshotted a fresh browser tab against `localhost:8099` (this project's own `unbegotten-dev` preview server) at both extremes, then reverted both temp edits. At full intensity the seams read as a broad, soft wash rather than bright threads; at low intensity the innermost ring boundary is a dim, gently-spreading glow rather than a crisp faint line — both read as light sitting near the seam, not a mark on top of it. `make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean (one `HourglassModelTest` failure seen mid-session turned out to be a stale `bin/test.js` from an interrupted rebuild, not a regression — a clean rerun afterward passed all 3205 assertions).

Raised, not yet actioned: the same message also floated "we could eventually make the whole tower dimmer, so it lights up more when we touch grounds" — dimming the tower's own base/ambient lighting so the glow's contrast reads more dramatically as the fall counter climbs. Framed as a tentative, later idea rather than part of this round's ask; left alone pending confirmation on scope (it'd touch the tower's base rendering broadly, not just this one shader) rather than assumed into this pass.

## 2026-07-19 — Shrine 20% taller again, glow gain slowed, tower dimmed

Three direct asks together. **Shrine**: `MazeShrine.WALL_HEIGHT` `10` → `12` (`10 × 1.2`) — no new reasoning beyond the number itself, same history comment extended.

**Glow gain too fast**: "the glow gains in intensity too fast, too bright too fast." `TowerModel.fallGlowIntensity` was a straight `fallCount / GOAL_LEVELS` — linear against the touched percentage. The actual problem: `TileRingGlow`'s own `reach = intensity * 5.0` fully saturates the first ring boundary the instant `intensity >= 0.2`, i.e. after only 4 of 20 floors — noticeably bright well before the player's covered much of the descent at all. Squared the curve instead (`touched * touched`) — same `0`/`1` endpoints, but `0.2` touched now yields `0.04` intensity and `0.5` touched yields `0.25`, pushing most of the glow's visible growth back toward the player having covered nearly the whole tower rather than the first few floors.

**Tower dimmed**: "tackle the base ambient lighting reduction in the tower... let's see where it gets us." New `graphics.shaders.Dim` — a one-line multiply of whatever's already in `output.color` by a flat `brightness` — added to both the floor and wall mesh's own shader list in `TowerMesh.build`, right after each one's `UnlitTexture` (so the base stone gets dimmed) but, on the floor, *before* `TileRingGlow` (so the glow itself stays at full strength, added on top of the now-darker base rather than getting dimmed along with it). New `TowerMesh.AMBIENT_BRIGHTNESS = 0.5`, first-pass value. Not folded into `UnlitTexture` itself, same discipline as `TileRingGlow`'s own — that shader is shared by every mesh in the project (`HubMesh`, `Hourglass`, `PaintingModel`, `GridMesh`, …), so a one-biome darkening doesn't belong there.

Verified all three together with the usual static technique (temp overrides + temp spawn points, reverted after): the tower now reads meaningfully darker at rest, with the floor glow popping with much more contrast against it at both full and half (new-curve) intensity; the shrine's walls now clear the surrounding grass by even more than before, painting still seated correctly on the taller wall. `make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean (3205 assertions, 0 failures).

## 2026-07-19 — Hourglass, round three: flip pivot, sand glow, and a real physics bug in the flip

Screenshot plus two asks. **The pivot bug, found from the screenshot alone**: the object visibly sat lower after a flip than before. `tiltedBasis` (round two) rotated everything around the fixed pivot at the assembly's own *base* — fine for the small everyday lean (reads like something rocking on a point near its own floor), but a full 180° around a point well below the object's own middle swings that middle out to the opposite side of the pivot, net displacement, not an in-place flip. Fixed by rotating around a fixed world-space *center* (`BULB_HEIGHT` above the base) instead, deriving `origin` from that center rather than the other way around — the center now stays exactly put at any angle, flipped or not. Small side effect, not asked for but consistent with the object already floating clear of the pedestal: the everyday lean now swings a little around the middle too, not only the base.

**A second, deeper bug turned up while fixing the first, not visible in the one screenshot provided**: `buildSand`'s two sand shapes — a pile hanging from the neck (draining, apex fixed at the neck) and a mound resting on a cap (filling, base fixed on the floor) — were pinned to "local top" and "local bottom" respectively, unconditionally. That's only correct while `model.flipped` is false; every *other* cycle, the local-top region is actually the physically-*lower* one (see the pivot fix above and `Hourglass.tiltedBasis`'s own doc — a flip only rotates the frame this is drawn in, it doesn't relabel which region is which), so the filling side was rendering with the *hanging* formula (fixed at the neck, growing a flat surface away from it) instead of the *mound* formula (fixed on its own floor, growing a peak toward the neck) — visibly, sand appearing to grow downward from the neck into the bottom section rather than mounding up from its own floor, exactly the "grows from the top to the bottom of the bottom section" reported directly. `buildSand` now works out which local region is physically upper (`localTopIsUpper = !model.flipped`) and feeds the right fraction/direction into whichever shape function that region needs (`addHangingPile`/`addMound`, both now direction-aware via a `direction:Int` parameter — `+1` or `-1` depending which way "away from the neck" points for that region) rather than always the same one. Renamed `SAND_TOP_*`/`SAND_BOTTOM_*` constants to `SAND_HANGING_*`/`SAND_MOUND_*` to match — they were never really about top/bottom, only about which *shape*, and kept the old names past that point would've been actively misleading now that either shape can land on either local region.

**Sand glow**: "make the sand emit light, same kind as the glow in the tower" (`graphics.shaders.TileRingGlow`). That shader's own math is UV/ring-boundary geometry specific to a textured floor decal — nothing a solid sand mesh has an equivalent of — so reached for the same *visual* result instead of porting the shader: new `buildSandGlow` draws the exact same sand triangles a second time (shares the already-built `h3d.prim.Polygon`, no rebuild), additive-blended (`h3d.mat.BlendMode.Add`) at a near-white tint (new `Colours.HOURGLASS_SAND_GLOW`, plain white, same "no colour, emit white light" choice `TileRingGlow` already made) — the same plain double-draw trick `buildGlass`/`buildGlassHighlights` already use for their own semi-transparent passes, just additive instead of alpha.

`make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean. Not verified in-browser again — same tooling limitation, though this round `window.innerWidth` did read correctly on one fresh-tab attempt while the canvas itself stayed fixed at its tiny fallback size regardless (confirms the canvas size is latched once, early, and never revisited on any later resize signal — dispatching a synthetic `resize` event had no effect either). Screenshot-based review from hooman's own browser remains the only working path for this object.

## 2026-07-19 — Hourglass, round four: from a proximity lean to walk-up-and-bump signs, plus a real hidden mechanic

The biggest ask yet on this object, several pieces together: raise the pedestal and the hourglass a bit further; add a glowing `+`/`-` sign on opposite sides of the pedestal; replace the old continuous lean-based tilt with discrete stepped tilting (10° increments, up to 80° either way) triggered by walking up to a sign as close as collision permits (one step per approach — "the player has to stop and walk again to trigger it again"); and a hidden mechanic: push past the minus floor enough consecutive times and the hourglass snaps back to neutral, unlocking something represented by gold sand. Explicitly deferred: animating the tilt/flip transitions themselves — asked for later, built to snap instantly for now.

**Raised further**: `PEDESTAL_HEIGHT` `3.5` → `4.5`, `LEVITATION_HEIGHT` `1.4` → `2.0` — plain bumps, no new reasoning, plus the taller pedestal gives the two new signs more face to mount on.

**The signs**: new `buildSigns`/`addSign`, called once from `build` (they're mounted on the never-tilting pedestal, not the tilting assembly above it) — a `-` is one bar, a `+` is that same bar plus a second crossing it, both flat quads pushed slightly proud of the pedestal's own curved face along its local outward normal at that angle (`surfaceNormal`), oriented along the face's own local tangent (`surfaceTangent`) rather than a fixed world axis so they don't twist out of the curve. "Glow the same way as the sand" taken as *technique and color both* — same `Colours.HOURGLASS_SAND`/`_SAND_GLOW` double-draw `buildSand` already used, factored out into a shared `addGlowOverlay(container, prim, color, alpha)` (renamed from the sand-only `buildSandGlow`) so both call it.

**Stepped, player-triggered tilt replaces the old continuous lean entirely**: `HourglassModel.tiltSteps` (`-8` to `8`, `10°` each — matches `MAX_TILT_STEPS`/`STEP_ANGLE_DEGREES`) instead of a continuously-approached `tiltAngle` field; `tiltAngle` is now a plain method, `tiltSteps * STEP_ANGLE_RADIANS`, snapped instantly (no smoothing left in — the ask's own "we'll animate this later" scoped that out on purpose). New `Hourglass.triggerSide(basis, playerPos):TriggerSide` (`None`/`Plus`/`Minus`, the enum living in `Hourglass.hx` since it's what that query produces) replaces `lean` — a stateless "how close, how lined-up" check against the pedestal's own collision boundary plus a margin (`SIGN_TRIGGER_DISTANCE_MARGIN`) and an angular tolerance around each sign's own exact bearing (`SIGN_ANGLE_TOLERANCE`). The actual "stop and walk again" rule can't live in that stateless query, though — `HourglassModel.tick` keeps `lastTriggerSide` and only steps on an actual edge (`triggerSide != None && triggerSide != lastTriggerSide`), so holding position against a sign (walked in, still pressed against it) doesn't keep incrementing every tick; leaving the trigger zone and coming back is what re-arms it. `PROXIMITY_RANGE` and the old `MAX_TILT`/`TILT_APPROACH_RATE`/`RESET_RATE`/`REVERSE_TRIGGER_SCALE`/`reversing` all removed outright rather than left dead — none of them had a meaning left once tilt stopped being continuous and proximity-driven.

**The hidden mechanic replaces the old `reversing` safety valve** (same underlying idea `docs/open/ideas-backlog.md`'s own "Reverse-time mechanic" backlog entry always named, just a different trigger shape now): new `overdraftCount`, incremented each time a `Minus` trigger lands while `tiltSteps` is already pinned at `-MAX_TILT_STEPS` (and reset to `0` the instant it isn't — either a successful decrement or a `Plus` trigger), and a new `unlocked:Bool`, set permanently once `overdraftCount` reaches `OVERDRAFT_UNLOCK_COUNT` (`10`, "for now" per the ask) — at which point `tiltSteps` snaps back to `0` too. `Hourglass.buildSand` reads `unlocked` to swap both the sand's fill and its glow to new gold variants (`Colours.HOURGLASS_SAND_GOLD`/`_GOLD_GLOW`) rather than the usual icy ones — nothing else reacts to it yet, deliberately, same "prototype the trigger, not the payoff" discipline as everything else backlogged there.

Full test rewrite for both `HourglassModelTest` (new stepped-tilt/edge-trigger/overdraft cases, replacing every lean/reversing one) and `HourglassTest` (new `triggerSide` cases — on-bearing close-in for both signs, too far, off to the side, and the two angle-tolerance boundary cases — replacing every `lean` one), plus the antipodal-height regression case ported over to `triggerSide` alongside `blocksMovement`'s own copy. `make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean. Not verified in-browser — same tooling limitation as every prior round on this object.

## 2026-07-19 — Hourglass, round five: signs flush and tilt-reactive, tilt axis swapped, sand halo, light blue default

Four more direct notes on round four. **Signs stuck to the surface**: `SIGN_INSET` `0.25` → `0.15` — a bar this size's own sagitta against `PEDESTAL_RADIUS` (the chord-vs-arc gap `entities.painting.PaintingModel.buildArcQuad`'s own doc already covers) works out to close to `0.13`, so the original inset was clearing that by a wide, visibly-hovering margin; the new one only clears it by a hair, reading as flush.

**Sign glow now reacts to tilt**: "both start at 50% glowing intensity... one sign glows 10% more, and the other 10% less" as it tilts. New `Hourglass.signGlowAlpha(model, isPlus)` — `SIGN_GLOW_BASE_ALPHA` (`0.5`) shifted by `SIGN_GLOW_STEP` (`0.1`) per step of `model.tiltSteps`, toward whichever sign the tilt currently favors and away from the other, clamped to `[0, 1]` (so it saturates at 5 steps rather than actually reaching `HourglassModel.MAX_TILT_STEPS`, a deliberate consequence of the flat "per step" reading rather than a scaled-to-fit-the-full-range one). This forced an architectural change: the signs used to be part of the pedestal's own one-time `build`, but their glow now depends on live model state, so `buildSigns`/`addSign` moved into `buildDynamic` (rebuilt every tick, mounted against the untilted `basis` same as always — only their *glow*, not their position, needed to become dynamic) and each sign became its own mesh pair (base + glow) instead of one shared draw, so each can carry its own alpha.

**Tilt axis swapped**: "so the player sees better." `tiltedBasis` rotated around `vAxis` — the *same* axis the two signs sit along (`uAxis`, angle `0`/`Math.PI`) is perpendicular to it, meaning the actual lean happened in the `uAxis`/`up` plane, straight toward or away from whoever's standing at either sign — foreshortened nearly to nothing from exactly the vantage point a player watching their own tilt take effect would be standing at. Swapped to rotate around `uAxis` instead (mirroring the rotation math exactly, `vAxis` swapping roles with `uAxis`), so the lean now happens in the `vAxis`/`up` plane — squarely side-to-side across that same viewer's line of sight. The center-preserving fix from round three carries over unchanged, just with the two in-plane axes swapped.

**Sand halo + light blue default**: "give the sand more glow, more of a halo... try making it light blue." `SAND_GLOW_ALPHA` `0.3` → `0.4` (more glow, flat bump), plus a new, wider second additive pass (`buildSandHalo`, `SAND_HALO_SCALE = 1.4`, `SAND_HALO_ALPHA = 0.15` — dim enough to read as a soft spread rather than a second equally-bright copy). Rather than hand-building separate halo geometry, factored the actual pile/mound-building logic out of `buildSand` into `buildSandShape(tilted, model, radiusScale, includeGrains)`, called twice (`radiusScale = 1` for the real sand, `1.4` for the halo, which also skips the stream grains — a scaled-up tiny octahedron reads as a blob, not a wider dot) — keeps the halo's own silhouette locked to the real sand's exactly, just wider, instead of two hand-tuned shapes that could drift apart later. `Colours.HOURGLASS_SAND` (also the signs' own base fill, sharing that constant) `0xFFE6F2FB` (near-white) → `0xFF7FD4EC` (a clear light blue) — the glow colors (`_SAND_GLOW`, still plain white) untouched, so "without removing the glow" held automatically.

New `HourglassTest` cases for `signGlowAlpha` (neutral-tilt baseline, the 10%-per-step shift both directions, clamping at max tilt) — the one new piece of pure logic this round; everything else is scene/rendering, per this project's own testing boundary. `make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean. Not verified in-browser — same tooling limitation as every prior round on this object.

## 2026-07-19 — Hourglass, round six: halo pulled, signs actually bent onto the pedestal

Two more direct notes. **Halo removed**: "disappointing" — pulled `buildSandHalo` and the `SAND_HALO_SCALE`/`_ALPHA` constants entirely, and folded `buildSandShape` back into a plain `buildSand` (no more `radiusScale`/`includeGrains` parameters propagating through `addHangingPile`/`addMound` for a caller that no longer exists) rather than leaving that generality sitting around unused. `SAND_GLOW_ALPHA` stays at last round's `0.4` — the ask was about the halo specifically, not the tight overlay.

**Signs actually bent onto the pedestal, not just close to it**: "bend along the pedestal, and be in contact with it." Round five's fix only shrank the *inset* (how far proud of the surface the sign sits); the sign itself was still one flat chord cutting across the curve, so shrinking the inset far enough to look flush at the chord's own center would have buried its own ends inside the stone (the same sagitta problem `entities.painting.PaintingModel.buildArcQuad`'s own doc walks through) — the real fix needed the geometry itself to curve, not just sit closer to average. `addSign`'s single flat `addBar` split into two direction-aware pieces: `addHorizontalBar` (the bar spanning both signs, and the `+`'s own horizontal stroke) now sweeps `SIGN_ARC_SEGMENTS` (`6`) facets across the pedestal's own true curve — every vertex a real `ringPoint` at its own angle, not an averaged one — while `addVerticalBar` (the `+`'s own vertical stroke) stays a single flat quad, since it runs along `up`, which a cylinder has zero curvature in regardless of how it's built. With the curvature itself handled properly, `SIGN_INSET` could drop to a bare `0.02` — just enough to clear z-fighting against the stone texture, not to paper over a geometry gap — reading as genuinely stuck to the pedestal rather than merely closer to it than before.

`make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean — no test changes this round (both fixes are pure geometry/visual, nothing pure-logic to add beyond what already covers `triggerSide`/`signGlowAlpha`). Not verified in-browser — same tooling limitation as every prior round on this object.

## 2026-07-19 — Hourglass, round seven: finer tilt steps, and the sign glow bug hooman actually caught

**Tilt steps**: "tilt 5° each time up to 45° max," down from `10°`/`80°`. `HourglassModel.STEP_ANGLE_DEGREES` `10` → `5`, `MAX_TILT_STEPS` `8` → `9` (`9 × 5 = 45`).

**The sign glow was a real bug, not a request** — asked directly, "are you relying on textured colours and no glow?" Traced it down: round five's `signGlowAlpha` genuinely did vary (confirmed by its own passing unit tests), but the *visual* result never changed, because the sign's own base fill (`Colours.HOURGLASS_SAND`) was always drawn fully opaque, and additive white on top of an already-bright, fully-opaque color clips every channel to `255` at a low alpha — nowhere near the top of the `[0, 1]` range the glow's own alpha swept across. Past that clip point, more alpha does nothing at all, which is exactly "looks the same no matter what." hooman's own diagnostic question was closer to right than the actual mechanism: not textures, but the *fill* swallowing the glow's own headroom the same way a texture would have.

**Fix**: the fill itself is what now scales, not just an additive layer on top of a fixed one. `buildSign`'s base mesh switched from an opaque `FixedColor` to `h3d.mat.BlendMode.Alpha` at `intensity` as its own alpha — near `0`, the sign is mostly transparent and blends into the pedestal stone behind it (genuinely "nearly imperceptible," not a saturated block with no glow); near `1`, it's the normal opaque bright fill plus full glow on top. Renamed `signGlowAlpha` → `signIntensity` to match (it drives both layers now, not just the glow), and reworked the formula itself, not just the fix: "equal on both sides at first... up to being real bright on one side and nearly imperceptible on the other" reads as spanning the *whole* tilt range, not saturating a few steps in — `signIntensity` now scales proportionally to `tiltSteps / HourglassModel.MAX_TILT_STEPS`, reaching exactly `1`/`0` only right at max tilt (`SIGN_NEUTRAL_INTENSITY * (1 ± t)`) rather than the old flat `±10%` per step that clamped well short of the actual max.

New `HourglassTest` cases for `signIntensity` (neutral baseline, proportional mid-tilt, and the fully-bright/fully-dim pair at max tilt each direction) replacing the old `signGlowAlpha` ones. `make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean. Not verified in-browser — same tooling limitation as every prior round on this object; this fix in particular is worth a direct look since it was diagnosed from a written description alone, not a screenshot.

## 2026-07-19 — Hourglass, round eight: a screenshot at last, and the plus sign it caught

First actual screenshot of this object this whole run — round seven's own fix was diagnosed blind, from a written description alone. Two things it showed, both fixed directly.

**The `+` looked "poorly adjusted."** Root cause: `buildSign`'s own base fill is alpha-blended now (round seven's fix for the additive-glow-saturating-on-an-opaque-fill bug), and the `+`'s horizontal and vertical bars are two *separate* meshes whose geometry actually overlapped in the middle — where a `+`'s two strokes naturally cross. Two alpha-blended quads stacked on the exact same patch of stone don't just average together; they compound into a visibly denser, differently-shaded square right at the crossing, breaking what should read as one uniform sign into two mismatched-looking bars. `addVerticalBar` now builds two separate segments (above and below the horizontal bar, via a new small `addVerticalBarSegment` helper) instead of one bar running straight through it, leaving a `SIGN_BAR_THICKNESS`-wide gap exactly where the horizontal bar already owns that square — no more overlap, no more compounding. Bumped `SIGN_ARC_SEGMENTS` `6` → `10` alongside it — the horizontal bar's own facets read as a visible kink at this close a range, and a smoother sweep reads as a clean bend instead.

**"I don't want the sign to disappear entirely either."** Direct, and correct: `signIntensity`'s own range (round seven) ran all the way to `0` at the far end of the tilt scale, and the neutral-tilt screenshot (both signs already at the range's own literal midpoint, `0.5`) still read as washed-out and barely-there — a real floor was needed, not just a lower saturating value. New `SIGN_MIN_INTENSITY = 0.15`: `signIntensity` now scales between that and `1` (`hxd.Math.lerp`) instead of `0` and `1`, so even at the most extreme tilt away from a given sign, some real, deliberate presence remains rather than the sign fully vanishing into the stone.

New `HourglassTest` cases for the shifted range (midpoint/floor values now reference `Hourglass.SIGN_MIN_INTENSITY` directly rather than hardcoded `0`/`0.5`, plus one asserting the floor is never actually `0`). `make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean. Not verified in-browser this round either — but unlike every prior round, this one's fixes were at least confirmed against a real screenshot of the actual reported problem, not diagnosed from text alone.

## 2026-07-19 — The hourglass's own speed effect goes global

"I'd like the effect of the hourglass to extend to every biome. The speed [e]ffect should be global." Until now, `GameLoop.fixedUpdate` only ever read `currentBiome.timeScale()` — the multiplier the hourglass's own tilt produces, but only while the hub itself was the biome the player happened to be standing in; walking out reset the player straight back to `1`, undoing the effect entirely, something `Biome.timeScale`'s own doc already flagged as "not a deliberate design call yet, just the smallest thing that matches the ask" at the time it was written.

**The trigger stays local; only the effect goes global.** Walking up to a `+`/`-` sign to change the tilt still only makes sense physically inside the hub — nowhere else has the sign geometry, or a position in the hub's own coordinate space to check against. What needed to change was just *where `GameLoop` reads the resulting multiplier from*. New `BiomesRegistry.globalTimeScale()`: the product of every *registered* biome's own `timeScale()`, not just whichever is current — `BiomesRegistry` already holds a live, persistent instance of every biome for the whole session (confirmed: `HubBiome` and its `hourglassModel` field are never recreated on leaving/re-entering, only the *scene meshes* get torn down and rebuilt), so the hub's own value is always sitting there to read regardless of where the player currently is. `GameLoop.fixedUpdate`'s own `scaledDt` now multiplies by `biomeRegistry.globalTimeScale()` instead of `currentBiome.timeScale()` — one line changed at the actual call site.

Deliberately *not* done: making `HubBiome.tick()` itself run globally too (which would also keep the sand/flip-cycle animating, and re-check `triggerSide` against a position) — `tiltSteps` only ever changes via a discrete player trigger, which can't happen anywhere but the hub anyway, so the multiplier it produces is already stable/correct wherever it's read from; ticking a non-current biome would mean rebuilding scene geometry into a detached, unrendered container for no visible benefit, and checking `triggerSide` against a player position that isn't even in the hub's own coordinate space.

Updated doc comments to match the new contract: `Biome.timeScale()` itself is now documented as "this biome's own *contribution* to the global multiplier," combined by `BiomesRegistry.globalTimeScale` rather than read directly off whichever is current; `HourglassModel`'s own class doc drops the old "scoped to the hub only, not global" framing entirely, replaced with the trigger-vs-effect distinction above.

New `BiomesRegistryTest` cases for `globalTimeScale` (empty registry, every biome at `1`, and one that actually differs — a configurable `ownTimeScale` added to the test's own `StubBiome` to drive that). `make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean. Not verified in-browser: confirming this needs walking between biomes while the hourglass is tilted, which this session's own tooling can't reliably drive (per this project's own `CLAUDE.md`) even setting aside the unrelated canvas-sizing issue affecting every round on this object so far — asked hooman to check directly.

## 2026-07-19 — Tower doubled downward, extended above spawn, and the hourglass secret's own payoff

Two direct asks. **The descent doubled and gained a few unreachable levels above spawn.** `TowerModel.GOAL_LEVELS` (the descent proper, spawn to goal) `20` → `40` — "increase its size downwards by as much as it is already." Alongside it, a new `ABOVE_SPAWN_LEVELS` (`4`) — real shaft above the entrance, generated and built the same as every other layer, but not reachable by any normal means today (falling only goes down; `JUMP_IMPULSE` can't clear a full `LAYER_HEIGHT`) — "will be used later for something or other," not wired to anything yet.

This meant `layer` could no longer be "0 at spawn" — there's real shaft above it now. `layer` throughout `TowerModel`/`TowerGenerator`/`TowerMesh` is now a *physical* index, `0` (the shaft's own topmost layer) to `TOTAL_LEVELS - 1` (the bottom, still always solid); the entrance sits at the new `SPAWN_LAYER` (`= ABOVE_SPAWN_LEVELS`) instead. `layerY`/`layerAt` shifted to pivot around `SPAWN_LAYER` rather than `0`; `TowerGenerator.densityAt` interpolates `FLOOR_DENSITY_START`→`_END` only across the descent (`SPAWN_LAYER` to `TOTAL_LEVELS - 1`), reading the same easiest, entrance-level density for anything above spawn rather than extrapolating the curve backward past its own start. Every "layer 0"/`GOAL_LEVELS - 1` reference across `TowerBiome`/`TowerMesh` (entrance painting, goal painting, spawn, the falls-counter array) moved to `SPAWN_LAYER`/`TOTAL_LEVELS - 1` accordingly. `TowerCollision` needed no changes at all — it already worked in plain physical layer indices throughout.

**The hourglass secret now actually does something.** `HourglassModel.unlocked` (round four's hidden mechanic, previously just a sand-color swap with nothing else reacting) now also disables the tower's own falls counter and lights its floor in full, gold. `TowerBiome` takes the same shared `HourglassModel` instance `HubBiome` ticks (constructor-injected from `GameLoop`, which now builds the one instance and hands it to both — neither biome reaches into the other's own instance, same discipline `biomes.common.Biome`'s own class doc already asks for) and reads only `unlocked` off it. `markTouched` turns into a no-op entirely once `unlocked` (the counter is disabled, not just capped), and `build()` sets the gold, full-intensity glow directly if the secret was already triggered on some earlier hub visit before this entry. `graphics.shaders.TileRingGlow` gained a `glowColor:Vec3` param (defaulting white) in place of its old hardcoded `vec3(1,1,1)`, so `TowerMesh.setFallGlow` can now take an optional tint; new `Colours.TOWER_SECRET_GLOW` reuses `HOURGLASS_SAND_GOLD_GLOW` directly rather than a second, unrelated gold constant.

Updated `TowerModelTest`/`TowerGeneratorTest`/`TowerCollisionTest` throughout for the physical-layer-index split (`layerY`/`layerAt` now pivot on `SPAWN_LAYER`, `densityAt` covers the above-spawn plateau, every array/bound sized off `TOTAL_LEVELS` rather than `GOAL_LEVELS`). `make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean (4838 assertions). Not verified in-browser: the secret itself takes ten-plus consecutive overdraft triggers in the hub to reach, on top of this project's own general "Claude can't reliably drive movement/interaction in this preview" limitation — asked hooman to check directly.

## 2026-07-19 — New biome: a Möbius ribbon with more than one twist

hooman's own framing: a walkable band closed into a loop like a Möbius strip, but with more than one half-twist before the ends join — gameplay identical to an ordinary single-twist Möbius strip (walk far enough around, arrive mirrored), the open question purely visual: how a higher twist count actually looks. Tried with 3 twists first, twist count kept as a real parameter rather than hardcoded. Scoped down twice via direct Q&A before building anything: **bare ribbon only** (no maze/walls/gaps, just the ribbon's own edges — evaluate the twisted shape and the walk-around-and-return-mirrored feel in isolation, per this file's own "prototype the cheapest version first" pillar) and **a minimal hub marker** (a single floating framed painting, no surrounding landmark structure) rather than a polished landmark like `TowerReplica`'s spire.

**The geometry**: `biomes.common.space.mobius.MobiusMath`, parametrized by `u` (angle around the loop) and `v` (across-width offset), `theta(u) = twists * u / 2`, `P(u,v) = ((radius + v*cos(theta))*cos(u), v*sin(theta), (radius + v*cos(theta))*sin(u))` — the standard generalization of the classic Möbius ribbon formula to more than one half-twist. Worked through (and had independently re-derived/checked) the key properties before writing any biome code: the flip identity `P(u+2*PI, v) == P(u, v*(-1)^twists)` (exact, no approximation) is what produces the "walk once around, arrive mirrored" feel for odd twist counts with zero special-casing; `Pu . Pv = 0` holds at *every* `(u, v)`, not just near the centerline, so the local `{tu, tv, normal}` frame `localFrameAt` builds is a genuine orthonormal basis everywhere, meaning `MobiusSpace.moveAlong` (a `biomes.common.space.common.Space` implementation, alongside `SphereSpace`/`FlatSpace` — the first one that's per-instance rather than a shared singleton, since `twists`/`radius` are construction parameters) can decompose/reconstruct `forward` against it exactly, with only the finite-step-vs-geodesic approximation every other `Space` already accepts. Wrapping `u` back into `[0, 2*PI)` flips `v`'s sign one loop at a time whenever `twists` is odd, composing correctly across repeated wraps. `upAt` genuinely flips sign right at the `u = 0` seam for odd `twists` — documented as an inherent, unavoidable consequence of the surface being non-orientable, not a bug to chase out.

**The rest of the biome** (`biomes.mobius`): `MobiusModel` (topology constants — `RADIUS = 40`, `HALF_WIDTH = 6`, kept well under `RADIUS` so the ribbon can't self-intersect; `DEFAULT_TWISTS = 3`), `MobiusMesh` (a plain rectangular `(u, v)` grid sampled straight through `pointAt` and connected into quads — nothing Möbius-specific in the mesh code at all, since the twist/closure is entirely `pointAt`'s own doing; no art exists for this biome yet, so alternating flat `h3d.shader.FixedColor` bands, new `Colours.MOBIUS_BAND_A`/`_B`, stand in — and double as the actual diagnostic, since a colored band visibly spiraling as you walk is the plainest read on whether a twist count looks right), `MobiusCollision` (edge-of-ribbon boundary only, same "block the whole step" pragmatism `TowerCollision`/`HubCollision` already use), `MobiusBiome` (gravity via `Gravity.fallToSurface`, same as the hub/maze, not the tower's real free-fall — nothing to fall through on a bare ribbon).

**Hub side**: new `biomes.hub.MobiusWaypoint` — a single `PaintingModel.buildQuad` anchored via `HubStructure.anchorAt` at a fourth evenly-spaced equator slot (`Math.PI`, directly opposite spawn, exactly between the maze/tower anchors), no wall or spire behind it, so nothing blocks movement through its own footprint. No art asset for the painting either — `h3d.mat.Texture.fromColor` generates a flat placeholder in code instead of adding a new sprite file. `HubBiome` wired the same way as the other two landmarks (`build`/`exitPaintings`/`spawnPlayer`'s `switch`), registered in `GameLoop` as `new MobiusBiome()`.

New `MobiusMathTest` (flip identity, round-trip inversion, frame orthonormality, even-twist no-flip sanity) and `MobiusSpaceTest` (arc distance, forward stays unit/tangent, continuity and the v-flip across the loop seam) — both added to `TestMain`. `make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean (4908 assertions). Not verified in-browser: hit the same canvas-sizing issue every round on the hourglass object already ran into (canvas latched at a tiny fallback size, unresponsive to any resize signal) — asked hooman to check the shape and the walk-around feel directly.

## 2026-07-19 — Möbius ribbon, twice retuned in size

Two direct follow-ups after the first look. "Make it 10 times bigger in every direction": `MobiusModel.RADIUS` 40 → 400, `HALF_WIDTH` 6 → 60, same ratio — everything else (collision clearance, mesh resolution, spawn point, the hub-side entry) derives from those two constants, so nothing else needed to change.

"Same length, but thrice the width": `RADIUS` stayed at 400, `HALF_WIDTH` 60 → 180. Re-derived `MobiusMath`'s own precondition while making this change rather than just trusting the old "well under radius" framing: the actual requirement is just `HALF_WIDTH < RADIUS` (strictly, so `radius + v*cos(theta)` never reaches 0) — distinct `u` mod `2*PI` always land at distinct azimuths around the loop whenever that holds, which is already sufficient on its own to keep the ribbon from self-intersecting, not merely a safety margin toward it. Corrected the doc comment accordingly.

`make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean (4908 assertions, unchanged — pure constant/doc changes).

## 2026-07-19 — A forest for the Möbius biome, worked overnight unsupervised

hooman's ask: "make a forest out of the Moëbius Strip Biome... make a model of tree by yourself, like we did with the grass, only with a hitbox. Then sow and grow lots of them." Working overnight without hooman there to check in on, so two questions got asked and answered before starting rather than guessed at: whether "sow and grow" meant a real growth mechanic or a one-time scatter (answer: one-time scatter for now, like grass — real growth deferred, see this file's own `docs/open/ideas-backlog.md` backlog entry below for where that's noted for later), and whether the forest should leave a guaranteed clear lane or go fully dense (answer: fully dense, weave required, no guaranteed path).

**The tree itself** (`biomes.common.tree.TreeMesh`, new, in `biomes.common` rather than `biomes.mobius` — topology-agnostic, same reasoning `biomes.common.grass.GrassModel`'s own class doc gives for taking a sphere's `radius`/`isWalkable` as parameters instead of assuming one biome's own geometry): a plain cylindrical trunk plus two stacked, overlapping cones for foliage — the cheapest shape that still reads as a conifer, same "cheapest silhouette that still reads right" discipline the grass tufts' own crossed blades already use. Takes a tree's own local frame (`base`/`up`/`tangent`/`right`) rather than any biome-specific math; `MobiusMath.localFrameAt`'s own `{tu, tv, normal}` slots directly in as `{tangent, right, up}`, already exactly that orthonormal triple. No top/bottom caps (never visible from a player's own eye height) and `culling = None` on the meshes built from it, same call every other solid-looking mesh in this project already makes rather than getting each ring's own winding order exactly right.

**Placement** (`biomes.mobius.MobiusForestGenerator`, new): rejection sampling in `(u, v)` — uniform over `u` and the ribbon's own usable width (short of `MobiusModel.TREE_EDGE_MARGIN`), a known simplification since `MobiusMath`'s own metric isn't flat (`|Pu|` varies with `v` too), not worth correcting for a first pass. Minimum spacing (`MobiusModel.MIN_TREE_SPACING`, 12) is checked in real world 3D distance between resolved positions, not parameter distance — the only distance that matches what a player actually walks through. `MobiusModel.TARGET_TREE_COUNT` (2500) with a generous `TREE_SCATTER_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (200000) safety valve against the rejection sampling never converging — confirmed by test to comfortably clear 90% of target at that density. Each tree's own position is resolved to world `x`/`y`/`z` once at generation time rather than re-derived from `(u, v)` on every collision check (`biomes.mobius.MobiusCollision.tryMove` runs at 60Hz) — cheap for one tree, not free at 2500-many, every tick.

**The hitbox**: `MobiusCollision.isBlockedByATrunk` — trunk radius plus `MobiusModel.COLLISION_CLEARANCE` only, foliage purely visual, same "block the whole step" pragmatism the ribbon's own edge boundary already uses. A full linear scan against every tree, not a spatial index — direct ask was "fully dense, weave required," and the cost math (cheap even at target density, 60 times a second) says a `u`-bucketed grid isn't needed yet; noted as the natural fix if a much denser forest ever makes this measurably slow.

**Rendering** (`biomes.mobius.MobiusMesh.buildForest`): chunked into batches of `TREES_PER_CHUNK` (500) trees per trunk/foliage mesh pair — foliage alone is the worse case per tree (two cones, 3 vertices per triangle, no vertex sharing), and a single mesh spanning the whole forest would rack up more distinct vertices than `hxd.IndexBuffer`'s `Array<UInt16>` can actually index, the exact silent-wraparound bug `biomes.tower.TowerMesh.LAYERS_PER_CHUNK`'s own doc already ran into once. New `Colours.TREE_TRUNK`/`TREE_FOLIAGE` placeholders, no real art yet either.

**Persistence**: `MobiusBiome` now takes the generated `ForestLayout` constructor-injected from `GameLoop` (same "generate once, reuse for the whole session" shape `TowerBiome`/`MazeBiome` already use), rather than a bare ribbon with nothing to persist — a trunk's own hitbox is a real mechanic now, so re-rolling it fresh every visit would mean a path clear one visit could be blocked the next. `serialize`/`restore` delegate to `MobiusForestGenerator`'s own JSON (de)serialization, replacing the trivial `"{}"` the bare-ribbon version had nothing to save with.

New `MobiusForestGeneratorTest` (spacing invariant, edge margin, spawn clearance, size ranges, serialize round-trip, convergence at default scale) and `MobiusCollisionTest` (edge boundary plus the new trunk hitbox) — both added to `TestMain`. The spacing invariant check is `O(n^2)` pairs by nature, so that one test (and a few others alongside it, for consistency) generates a small explicit count (150) rather than the full default target — the invariant doesn't depend on how many trees actually get placed, and the first attempt at this ran the full 2500-tree default through it, producing something like 3.1 million assertions and multi-megabyte test output before this fix. `MobiusForestGenerator.generate` gained a `count` parameter for exactly this (defaulting to `MobiusModel.TARGET_TREE_COUNT`), same reasoning `GrassModel.scatter`'s own `count` parameter already gives.

`make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean (17741 assertions). Not verified in-browser: same canvas-sizing issue as every other round in this environment, compounded by working unsupervised overnight specifically so as not to need hooman there to check a screenshot — asked hooman to walk the new forest directly on their own return. Open questions from tonight's work (nothing here blocked finishing, but worth hooman's own read):

- Density/spacing (`MobiusModel.TARGET_TREE_COUNT`/`MIN_TREE_SPACING`) and tree size ranges are first-pass numbers, entirely unverified visually — could read as too sparse, too dense to physically walk through, or comically oversized/undersized against the ribbon.
- "Fully dense, weave required" was taken literally: no guaranteed clear lane anywhere, including near the entrance spawn and the hub-return trigger (beyond `MobiusModel.TREE_SPAWN_CLEARANCE`/`MobiusBiome.EXIT_ARC_OFFSET`'s own small clearances) — possible a bad random roll leaves an awkward, near-unwalkable pocket somewhere, given no retry-if-a-region-looks-bad logic exists.
- The real-growth-over-time idea is deferred and noted in `docs/open/ideas-backlog.md`'s backlog (tied to the hourglass's own already-global time-scale mechanism, per the ask), not built — confirm that's still the right call before anyone starts on it.

## 2026-07-19 — The forest trees, cleaned up and diversified

hooman, on first look: "the trees are awful... please make them a lot cleaner. Mix in a few models as well." No screenshot to diagnose from (same tooling limitation as every round), but the geometry itself pointed at a real construction bug: `addFoliage`'s two cones sat at `foliageRadius` starting exactly at `trunkHeight`, while the trunk's own top rim sat at `trunkRadius` — much narrower. Two disconnected shapes with a radius jump between them and no geometry actually filling that jump, so there was a visible ring-shaped hole at the trunk/foliage seam looking straight through into the (uncapped) foliage cone's own hollow interior. The previous version's own overlap-downward attempt at hiding this never actually closed it — an overlap only *disguises* a mismatch that's still there, it doesn't remove it.

**The real fix**: every ring segment's own base radius now exactly matches the previous segment's own tip radius — a continuous silhouette from the trunk's own top all the way to each species' own tip, by construction, not by an overlap fudge factor. `TreeMesh.addRing` (renamed/generalized from the old two-argument-radius version) already supported arbitrary base/tip radii; the fix was using that directly (start each foliage treatment's own first ring at `trunkRadius`, not jumping straight to `foliageRadius`) instead of two separate cones with a gap.

**Three species, not one**, per the ask to "mix in a few models": `MobiusForestGenerator.SPECIES_CONIFER` (a short collar flaring from the trunk out to full width, then two narrowing tiers to a point — the original layered-pine idea, now built as one continuous stack), `SPECIES_ROUND` (one continuous bulge out to an equator then back to a point — a rounder canopy silhouette), and `SPECIES_DEAD` (bare trunk, no foliage, a few stub branches instead — `TreeMesh.addDeadBranches`, derived entirely from the trunk's own height/radius and the tree's own `rotation` rather than needing yet more stored randomness). Rolled per tree at generation time (50%/35%/15%), stored as `PlacedTree.species` (a plain `Int`, not a real Haxe enum — stays JSON-serializable).

**Per-tree rotation** (`PlacedTree.rotation`, also new): spins each tree's own `tangent`/`right` ring basis around `up` before `TreeMesh` builds anything — without it, every tree's own faceted seams (and every dead tree's own branches, which are placed relative to that same basis) lined up identically, reading as stamped copies rather than a natural forest.

**Shading**: new `graphics.shaders.HeightGradient` (the color-mixing half of `GrassWind`, without the wind sway — a flat base-to-tip `mix`) replaces the flat `h3d.shader.FixedColor` fill trunks/foliage used before. A single flat color reads plasticky for a solid volumetric shape in a way it never did for the ribbon's own thin surface. `Colours.TREE_TRUNK_BASE`/`_TIP` and `TREE_FOLIAGE_BASE`/`_TIP` replace the old single-color `TREE_TRUNK`/`TREE_FOLIAGE`. `TreeMesh` now threads a UV buffer through every function (height fraction in `v`, `u` unused) for this.

New `MobiusForestGeneratorTest` cases for species (only ever a known constant, all three actually reachable at default chances) and rotation (stays within a full turn); existing manually-constructed `PlacedTree` literals in `MobiusCollisionTest` updated for the two new required fields. `make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` all clean (18044 assertions). Not verified in-browser — same limitation as ever; this round in particular was reasoned from the geometry math alone, without ever having seen the "awful" result being fixed, so worth a specific second look once hooman can actually check it.

## 2026-07-22 — game-design.md split into a docs/ folder

The single `docs/game-design.md` had grown four jobs with different
lifecycles — pillars, live story exploration, idea backlog, and rejected
alternatives. Split by lifecycle into `docs/`: `philosophy.md`
(pillars), `story-line.md` (current story state only), `ideas-backlog.md`
(not-yet-implemented ideas), `design-decisions-records.md` (append-only
records of decisions with their rejected alternatives and why — hooman's
standing preference for how decisions are kept), with the folder's
`README.md` defining how content moves between them. The old path was
first kept as a redirect stub, then removed the same day (hooman's call);
this log's older `docs/game-design.md` references — and the live ones in
`src/` doc-comments — were retargeted to the specific folder files
(backlog mentions → `ideas-backlog.md`, pillar mentions →
`philosophy.md`) rather than left dangling.

## 2026-07-29 — Making each biome's maze feel like its own place

Started as a design conversation (can mazes differ per biome, and how?),
turned into a research pass plus four pieces of implementation.

**Research and a new doc.** Looked outside the project for prior art and
kept the useful links, each with the specific transferable lesson, in a new
`docs/game/inspirations.md` (wired into the folder's `README.md`, this
repo's `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md`). The load-bearing reference is
**HyperRogue**: 72 lands whose mechanics each demonstrate a different
property of the hyperbolic plane — the same situation this game is in with
the sphere. That distilled into a rule the new backlog entries were judged
against: *a biome's mechanic should be a corollary of the sphere, not a
decoration on it — if it would work unchanged in a flat rectangular maze,
it's a reskin.* Deliberately **not** promoted into `philosophy.md` as a
pillar on the strength of one session; parked in the inspirations doc as a
pillar candidate, to be judged against a few real biome ideas first. Other
lessons taken: one reusable verb per dungeon and pick the gameplay before
the theme (Zelda), a whole area whose lesson is that one rule you relied on
is deleted (The Witness), the player editing the maze (Void Stranger),
drafting the layout as the gameplay (Blue Prince), identity from restriction
plus authored-skeleton/generated-detail (Dead Cells), and shifting a passage
as your move (Ravensburger's Labyrinth).

**Ideas parked** in `ideas-backlog.md`, all from hooman's own list: walls
that behave by a rule (metronome, close-behind-you, growth, Life-driven),
perception rules as the per-biome variable (ten candidates — candlelight,
inverse-legibility wall heights, centre-lit shadows onto the far side,
near-fade, mirror band, echo pulse, posture trade, one-snapshot memory,
drifting fog, compass), antipode pairs (tag/remove/carry, same or opposite),
great-circle corridors, junction drafting, verticality, subtle mark
tampering, the rosetta maze re-explained from scratch, and per-biome maze
recipes. Two of those entries answer questions hooman asked directly:

- *Would Life-driven walls even work, given Life dies back?* Largely no, as
  suspected: random soup at the Conway biome's own density evaporates within
  a few dozen generations into scattered still lifes and blinkers — a mostly
  *open* board. Recorded with four ways it could still work (invert the
  mapping; seed deliberate patterns as level furniture; run Life only on
  edges layered over a static spanning tree so connectivity is guaranteed;
  or use a rule with a labyrinthine attractor — B3/S12345 is literally
  called "Maze"), and a recommendation of the last two together.
- *What would the codebase need to anticipate rule-driven walls?* Less than
  expected: wall state has exactly one chokepoint (`GridModel.isOpen`), which
  the mesh, collision and decoration all already query, so "walls that
  change" is a change *behind* one call. The rule to preserve is that nothing
  snapshots `openEdges` privately (one thing already derives state at load —
  `MazeExitWall.find`, cached on the biome — and would need re-deriving). The
  three real gaps: rebuild cadence (the whole sphere's walls are one
  `Polygon`, and `Biome.build` only runs on entry), no decided rule for a
  wall arriving around a *stationary* player (`wallZoneNeighbor`'s test is a
  movement test by construction, so it can't fire), and `Biome.serialize`
  encoding edges but not a rule's phase.

**Maze generation, once, for every topology.** The randomized-DFS carve was
copy-pasted per topology (`MazeGenerator` and `ConwayMaze` held the same loop
over the same string keys), so a second *style* would have been a per-biome
job. New `biomes.common.maze` package: a `MazeTopology` seam (opaque node
keys, adjacency, an edge's axis), `GridTopology`/`ConwayTopology` adapters,
and five styles — randomized DFS (the original, preserved loop for loop),
Prim, Kruskal, axis-biased DFS, recursive division — plus braiding as a
post-pass rather than a style, since it applies to any of them and is the one
thing that deliberately breaks the perfect-maze property. Recursive division
needed three adaptations for this surface, documented on the class; the
sharpest was that its seam wall at phi = 0 must have **no door**, because a
door there closes a full-width single-row corridor into a ring — caught by
the perfect-maze test failing by exactly one edge while every other style
passed. Every style is tested for connectivity and edge count against the
real grid (varying column count, merged poles) rather than a toy rectangle.
Edge-key format unchanged, so previously exported maze JSON still loads.

**A debug hub, and it's where the game now starts.** Getting into a
work-in-progress biome meant editing `GameLoop`'s own `enterBiome` call and
putting it back. `biomes.debug.DebugHubBiome` is a deliberately drab flat
room whose ring of labelled portals is derived from `BiomesRegistry.ids()`,
so a newly registered biome gets a portal for free. Explicitly *not* the real
hub: `HubBiome` is a designed, diegetic place, and bolting plain signage onto
it would spoil exactly that. Needed `graphics.LabelTexture`, the project's
first text-in-world (h2d drawn to a render target, reusing `PaintingModel`'s
quad unchanged), and it turned up two things worth remembering: a sign quad
must be proportioned like its texture, and painting quads mount **mirrored**
in tangent order — invisible for abstract art, not for text ("hub" rendered
"dud"). `HubBiome.spawnPlayer` also stopped throwing for an origin it has no
structure for, since the debug room warps in from outside the game's
geography by construction.

**Wind-led biome, the first perception-rule prototype**
(`biomes.wind.WindBiome`). A draft floods breadth-first out of the exit over
*open* edges only, so it runs along corridors rather than through walls; every
tuft leans downwind, so the whole sphere's grass is a flow field with one
convergence point. Chosen first of the ten perception ideas because it needed
no new mechanism — grid, collision, grass, sway shader and exit painting all
existed, leaving one BFS and a per-blade direction. Per-blade directions ride
in the vertex normal attribute (`h3d.prim.Polygon` already uploads it), so
the whole field is one draw call instead of one mesh per corridor; a separate
`GrassWindField` shader rather than a flag on `GrassWind`, so no other grass
mesh has to supply normals. **The finding the prototype existed to produce:**
at normal grass height the field is invisible from across the sphere — a blade
covers well under a pixel there, so its lean carries nothing and the
legible-at-distance premise fails silently. Blades scaled up until it reads
(4x read beautifully and towered over the camera; 1.8 puts them at eye level,
which turns out to be *on* the see-far-not-near pillar rather than a
compromise against it — waist-high grass hides the corridor you're standing
in). Still open, and left open on purpose: nothing stops a player following
the grass at their feet one tuft at a time.

**Exterior biome** (`biomes.exterior.ExteriorBiome`): the same maze walked on
the *outside* of the shell, where the surface curves away below the horizon
and the far side isn't hard to read but geometrically absent — the deliberate
inversion of the game's hook, worth one appearance as a revelation rather
than a biome to develop. It cost almost nothing, which is the notable part:
`GridModel`/`GridGeometry`/`GridCollision` work in theta/phi and don't care
which side of the shell the player is on, so the entire inversion is two sign
flips — `SphereExteriorSpace`'s own "up" (camera, gravity, turning and
strafing follow it automatically, because they read `PlayerModel.surfaceUp`
rather than assuming a direction) and `GridMesh.build`'s new `wallsOutward`.
Vindicates extracting the `Space` seam back on 2026-07-18 before there was a
second topology to retrofit against.

`make fmt`/`lint`/`check`/`test` clean throughout (18k+ assertions). The
debug hub, wind biome and exterior biome were each checked from a fixed
vantage point in-browser (including a temporary pitched-up spawn, since the
wind field's whole claim is about the view across the sphere); actually
*walking* them is hooman's, per `CLAUDE.md`'s own note on interactive
verification.

## 2026-07-29 — Release v0.13.0, and the two-sided maze

**Released and deployed.** Tagged `v0.13.0` (everything above), GHA built the
multi-arch image to GHCR, and the stack's `games` module was bumped and
deployed to prod (`make deploy ENV=prd MODULE=games`, over the SSH-tunnel
kubeconfig). Worth noting for the future: prod was still running **v0.10.0** —
`v0.11.0` and `v0.12.0` had been tagged but never deployed, which is exactly
the gap the manual-deploy choice in `README.md` leaves open. Three releases'
worth of changes went live at once. Verified: rollout complete, old pod gone,
`unbegotten.platypod.ovh` serving 200.

**Two-sided maze** (`biomes.twosided.TwoSidedBiome`), hooman's own idea, asked
for as "write it down and prototype it". One layout, walked from both sides of
the shell, and the two faces are complementary by construction rather than by
decoration:

- *Inside*: ordinary gravity, and the game's own hook — raise your head and the
  far side is laid out in front of you. You can see, but you're pinned into the
  corridors.
- *Outside*: gravity weak enough that a jump clears exactly three wall heights
  (`GRAVITY_OUTSIDE` is **derived** from `GameLoop.JUMP_IMPULSE` and
  `GridMesh.WALL_HEIGHT`, not guessed: 18² / (2 × 4.5) = 36 = 3 × 12), against
  a face where the surface curves away below the horizon so surveying is
  impossible. You can move, but you can't see — except for the few seconds of
  *local* vantage a leap buys.

The mechanic the two faces exist to serve, per the ask: see something from one
side, mark it, find the mark from the other. `MarkModel` posts **pierce** the
shell, standing out equally on both faces — the first thing in the game that
carries information between two viewpoints. Checked in-browser from a forced
outside spawn at the apex of a three-wall jump: the mark reads clearly over the
wall tops from ~40 units out, and the vantage genuinely works, though the view
at apex is mostly void (the exterior horizon drops away fast, so the useful
band is low).

Implementation notes worth keeping: `GridMesh.buildWalls` split out of `build`
so one shell can carry two wall sets without building the floor twice at the
same radius; `PlayerModel.space` stopped being `final` in favour of a
documented `switchSpace` that deliberately *jumps* the up-vector branch that
`applyMoveResult`'s continuity check exists to preserve — crossing to the other
side of a surface is precisely when "up" should reverse; and a new
`Biome.interact` hook (no-op in the other eight biomes), named for the input
rather than for marking, because wall-carry, junction drafting and scouting are
all "the player acted here" and none of them should want its own key.

Crossing sides is a **knowing placeholder**: the poles are open, marked with a
plain disc. The real mechanism is still open, and the candidate worth trying
first is noted in `docs/open/ideas-backlog.md` — a jump from the outside
strong enough to leave the surface and land on the inside, which would make the
two-gravity contrast itself the door. Also still open there: nothing yet
*requires* a mark, so the loop is a tool without a lock.

## 2026-07-29 — Correction: the wind field wasn't showing anything

Same day, straight after the entry above claimed the wind biome's field "reads
as directional grain from across the sphere". hooman looked at it and said it
appeared to show nothing at all. **They were right, and the earlier entry
over-claimed** — what the screenshot showed was the floor's own tiled grass
texture plus randomly-oriented blades, not the field. Three defects, only the
third of which is an outright bug:

1. **A zero-mean oscillation.** `sin(...) * amplitude` swings each blade
   symmetrically about its rest position, so nothing ever bent downwind. Even
   read perfectly, that conveys an undirected *axis* ("the draft runs
   east-west here"), never "the exit is that way".
2. **A random per-blade phase.** `GrassModel.scatter` assigns
   `phase = rng() * 2π` per tuft, so neighbouring blades were unrelated in
   time — no coherent motion to read.
3. **The gust-travel term was identically zero.** It computed
   `dot(relativePosition, windAxis)`, lifted from `GrassWind` where the axis is
   a fixed *world* direction and that dot is a real position projection. In the
   field version the axis is a *tangent* and `relativePosition` is radial, so
   the two are perpendicular and the term evaluated to ~0 everywhere. The
   travelling gust silently did nothing from the moment the field version was
   written.

Fixed by making the three things a readable field actually needs explicit, now
documented on `graphics.shaders.GrassWindField` and `biomes.wind.WindBiome`: a
**constant lean** (`leanBias`, kept above the gust amplitude so a gust never
swings a blade back past upright and re-introduces the ambiguity), a **gust
phase taken from the tuft's own distance from the exit**
(`WindField.PHASE_PER_STEP`, via the new `GrassMesh.WindSample` — so
`sin(time - place)` is a wave travelling downwind), and the blade size from
before. `GrassMesh`'s per-tuft callback now returns direction *and* flow
position instead of a bare direction, and a new test pins the phase ramp rising
step by step away from the exit, since that monotonic ramp is the whole
mechanism.

Verified as far as stills allow: up close the field bends unmistakably one way,
and from across the sphere the corridors visibly comb. **Not** verified, and
explicitly left that way: whether it's navigable. The half of the cue that
resolves direction is motion, which a screenshot cannot show — that judgement
needs someone walking it.

The generalisable lesson, now in the backlog's perception entry: a static cue
carries an axis, not a direction. Any perception mechanic that means to point
somewhere has to say how it resolves the 180° ambiguity, and motion is the
cheapest answer.

## 2026-07-29 — Documentation pass on docs/

hooman: the game-design folder is "hardly legible for a reader" and lacks images
or diagrams. Measured before changing anything, and the measurement moved the
plan: `ideas-backlog.md` was 458 lines carrying **5 headings** and single bullets
of **9,225** and **4,919** characters — so the primary problem wasn't missing
pictures, it was unscannable nested prose (much of it written earlier the same
day, in a decision-record register rather than a browsable one). Agreed scope:
full visual pass, hand-drawn style.

**Structure.** Every idea now has its own `###` heading (23 of them), so entries
are linkable and GitHub builds a TOC; an at-a-glance table up front maps each
idea to what it changes, its state and its cost; every entry follows one shape
(pitch → *Fits* → *Unproven* → *Cost*, with long reasoning in a collapsed
`<details>`); the perception candidates, the rule-driven wall variants and the
verticality routes became tables rather than nested bullet lists. Longest
paragraph is down from 9,225 to 1,930 characters and every internal anchor
resolves. The rule-driven-walls engineering block moved out to
`docs/building/notes/`, with a new convention: past ~25 lines outside its
details block, an entry is a design note and gets its own file.

**Six hand-drawn diagrams** (`docs/open/assets/*.svg`) for the ideas prose
is worst at: the two-sided shell in cross-section, antipode pairs, great-circle
corridors, inverse-legibility walls, centre-lit shadows, the rosetta maze.
Authored as text so they diff like code, on cream paper with ink strokes —
paper-backed deliberately, since a bare dark-stroke SVG vanishes against GitHub's
dark theme. Lesson recorded in the assets README: art in the middle, text only in
reserved top/bottom bands. The first attempt put labels over the drawing and was
unreadable; the second put inside and outside walls at the same x and they merged
into single bars (honest — it *is* the same maze — but illegible, fixed by
hatching the outside set).

**Mermaid diagrams** for things that are graphs rather than prose: the doc
lifecycle in the folder README, and the story-candidate map in `story-line.md`
(in play / parked / rejected, with the absorbed-and-salvaged edges). Plus a
"what exists today" table of the nine biomes with their surface and carve style.
Unverified locally — no mermaid renderer on this machine — so the syntax rests on
being standard GitHub-flavoured.

**A capture key for screenshots.** No screenshots exist yet, and this is why:
the automated browser preview can view the game but cannot write PNGs into the
repo. So the game now takes its own — `P` downloads the current view, fired from
`Main.render` because a `toDataURL` outside the render frame reads back entirely
black (measured: one distinct colour, `0,0,0` — Heaps builds its context without
`preserveDrawingBuffer`). The keypress-to-file chain is *not* confirmed end to
end: this browser neither delivers keys to the canvas reliably nor lets downloads
reach the filesystem. `docs/open/assets/README.md` carries the shot list —
eleven captures with the vantage that makes each legible — and the standing rule
that a screenshot older than the mechanic it illustrates is a bug.

One thing deliberately left plain: `philosophy.md`. The pillars are short,
load-bearing text, and precision matters there more than pleasantness.

## 2026-08-10 — story-line.md split into docs/archive/forsaken-storylines/, plus a design session

`story-line.md` moved to `docs/archive/forsaken-storylines/`: a `README.md`
carrying the map and requirements, plus one `candidate-<slug>.md` file per
candidate (`candidate-garden-of-eden.md`, `candidate-twisted-mythologies.md`,
`candidate-painters-house.md`), each prefixed `candidate-` until validated —
the prefix drops on the day one is chosen, same spirit as the 2026-07-22
`game-design.md` split, one level deeper now that individual candidates have
their own material to carry. `README.md`'s movement-rules table, the folder
`README.md`'s flowchart, and every cross-reference in
`design-decisions-records.md`/`ideas-backlog.md` retargeted; no content
rewritten in the move itself.

Design session on top of that move, all landing as additions rather than
decisions (nothing here is chosen yet, see the files themselves for what's
still open):

- **The glider stage, made literal.** The already-built geodesic Conway
  biome (12 pentagon beacons, see `ideas-backlog.md`'s "Deliberate pentagon
  activation" and "Walls that behave by a rule" entries) reread as the
  Garden of Eden candidate's glider-taxonomy stage in story terms: spawning
  a structure at a pentagon and reading whether it becomes a genuine
  traveler is the same test the player is undergoing one stage up. Solving
  the maze by riding or triggering a chain of gliders is now framed as
  earning that stage's own unlock — new information plus a new gameplay
  mechanism — rather than a generic reward.
- **Retroactive rediscovery via a gained sense**, new `ideas-backlog.md`
  entry: start missing a sense (colourblind is the seed example), gain it
  partway through, and biomes already solved turn out to have had an
  obvious path invisible the whole time. Framed as an evolution-stage
  unlock aimed at *reading* rather than *moving*, persistent and
  retroactive across every biome already visited rather than a fixed
  per-biome perception rule — the strongest "interconnected, not a level
  select" fit filed there yet on paper. Cheapest first cut: a global
  desaturation render pass, one colour-only route in an already-solvable
  biome.

Both land in `candidate-garden-of-eden.md` and `ideas-backlog.md`
respectively, explicitly marked as not yet reconciled with the rest of
either file.

## 2026-08-10 — Pentagon-composing interface, spec'd

Follow-up design round on the "Deliberate pentagon activation" backlog
entry: how the player actually builds the pattern they spawn at a
pentagon, worked through in a few passes rather than settled in one.
First pass (a `E`-opens-a-2D-grid-menu interface) was flagged against
the diegetic-over-chrome pillar directly rather than built as asked —
"a modal menu is the one moment that would break the sphere-interior
viewpoint" applies here as much as it did to the hub menu. Landed
instead on: the interface is an engraving on the pentagon's own floor
(a real object, not an overlay); `E` triggers a continuous camera
dolly-in, never a hard cut; editing is mouse click/raycast onto the
engraved cells — the one mouse-driven interaction in an otherwise
walk-and-`E` game, a deliberate exception because composing a pattern
one `E`-toggle at a time was judged too slow; the rest of the
simulation freezes while zoomed in (likely free — reuses the existing
`HourglassModel.timeScale`/`BiomesRegistry.globalTimeScale` dial rather
than needing a new pause mechanism); the composed pattern persists at
that pentagon across visits; and every ~20 ticks it's re-stamped onto
the live board regardless of what's alive there, a sustaining source
rather than a one-shot seed. Full detail in `ideas-backlog.md`'s
"Deliberate pentagon activation" entry, including one real open
question the re-stamp answer surfaced but didn't resolve: whether the
stamp overwrites the footprint exactly or only guarantees those cells
stay alive (OR) — left open, worth prototyping both.

## 2026-08-10 — Pentagon-composing interface, built

Resolved the one open question from the spec'd-but-not-built entry
above ("overwrite the footprint exactly" — a metronome, not an
OR-in-emergent-growth hybrid) and implemented the whole interaction.

New `tools.geodesic.GeodesicPentagonEngraving`: per-pentagon composed
pattern (node id → `0`/`1`), a pentagon's own 1-ring footprint (6 nodes,
computed once and cached — no ring/radius helper existed anywhere in
`tools.geodesic` before this, confirmed by search, so it's a small BFS
of its own rather than a reused one), toggle, and `tickAll` — called
unconditionally from `GeodesicConwayBiome.tick` every frame, restamping
any composed pentagon onto `GeodesicVentrellaState` every
`RESTAMP_INTERVAL_TICKS` (`20`) real ticks via `seedSingle`, regardless
of whether the player is currently there.

`biomes.common.Biome` gained two new interface methods —
`cameraOverride(player):Null<CameraOverride>` and
`onEditClick(ray:h3d.col.Ray):Void` — both no-ops (`return null;`/`{}`)
on every biome except `GeodesicConwayBiome`, same discipline `interact`
already established. `entities.player.Camera` gained the `CameraOverride`
typedef and `applyOverride`, the stateless counterpart to `applyTo` for
whatever a biome's own override hands back. `GameLoop.fixedUpdate` reads
`cameraOverride` once per frame: non-null both drives the camera
placement directly (skipping `Camera.applyTo`) and gates a new
`editingEngraving` flag that suspends normal movement/turning/gravity/
paintings for the frame (extracted into `handleMovement`, purely to keep
`fixedUpdate`'s own branching readable once it grew this second mode —
flagged by `checkstyle`'s `CyclomaticComplexity` at a `Warning` before
the extraction, clean after) and switches `window.mouseMode` to
`Absolute` for real cursor clicks, restored to `Relative` on exit.
`keepWantingRelativeMouse` had to become edit-mode-aware — left
unguarded it would force `Absolute` straight back to `Relative` the
instant the mode-change event fired.

`GeodesicConwayBiome.interact` enters/exits editing (entry gated on
actually standing on a pentagon node, `fineSphere.neighbors[nodeId].length
== 5`); `cameraOverride` dollies the camera in to `ENGRAVING_VIEW_HEIGHT`
above the pentagon, screen-up captured from the player's own facing at
the moment of entry (`tangentProject`) so the zoomed view doesn't spin
freely; `onEditClick` resolves the click's ray against the sphere
analytically (`h3d.col.Sphere.rayIntersection` — exact for a sphere, no
mesh-based picking needed) then `fineLookup.nodeAt` for which cell it
hit, same lookup collision/gravity already use. The engraving's own
generation-advance freeze (`accumulator`'s `while` loop skipped while
`editingPentagon != null`) is scoped to *that* board only —
`engraving.tickAll` runs every tick regardless, so an already-composed
pentagon keeps restamping on schedule even while a different one (or
none) is being edited. `GeodesicMesh.buildEngraving` draws the footprint
as flat panels, bright (`Colours.CONWAY_TILE_GLIDER`) on, dim
(`Colours.CONWAY_WALL_GLOW` at `35%`) off, lifted clear of every other
layer's own lift constant.

**E freed by retiring the debug export-maze tool**, per direct ask
rather than adding a second keybind: `Keybinds.EXPORT_MAZE` and
`GameLoop.exportMaze` are gone (git history has them back if wanted);
`Biome.serialize`/`restore` and L (import) are untouched — only the E
export trigger and its own function are removed, so nothing about the
save format changed. `Keybinds.INTERACT` moved from `F` to `E`
accordingly, doubling as the two-sided biome's own existing "drop a
mark" trigger — no behavior change there beyond the key.

Compiles clean, `checkstyle` clean (0 errors, 0 warnings — the one
`CyclomaticComplexity` warning `fixedUpdate` picked up mid-change was
resolved by the `handleMovement` extraction above, not suppressed), full
`utest` suite green. **Not exercised in the browser** — this project's
own standing note on Claude driving the game applies in full here
(mouse-look/click and WASD input don't reliably reach the canvas in this
environment); camera math, raycasting, and the restamp/freeze logic are
reasoned through and unit-testable in principle but have no test
coverage yet, and the whole interaction wants a real playtest before
trusting the untuned constants (`ENGRAVING_VIEW_HEIGHT`,
`RESTAMP_INTERVAL_TICKS`, `ENGRAVING_LIFT`/`_OFF_BRIGHTNESS`) or the feel
of the camera dolly/click-to-toggle loop itself.

## 2026-08-10 — Fixed: no cursor when entering a pentagon's engraving

Reported directly after the interface above shipped: no cursor appears
in configuration mode. Root cause was an ordering bug in `GameLoop`'s
own mouse-mode switch, exactly the kind the "not exercised in the
browser" caveat above was flagging as a real risk, not boilerplate
hedging.

`fixedUpdate`'s transition block wrote `window.mouseMode = Absolute`
*before* updating `editingEngraving`. `hxd.Window.set_mouseMode`
(`hxd.Window.js.hx`) calls `onMouseModeChange` —
`keepWantingRelativeMouse` — *synchronously*, as the first thing it
does, before touching pointer lock at all. So at the exact moment
entering was requested, `keepWantingRelativeMouse` still read the *old*
`editingEngraving == false`, took its normal (non-editing) branch, and
returned `Relative(onMouseMove, true)` right back — silently overriding
the very assignment that triggered it. The mode never left pointer
lock, the browser never released the native cursor, and
`window.mouseX`/`mouseY` never started tracking real cursor position
either (Relative mode doesn't update them) — `onEditClick` would have
raycast from a stale/zero position had a click even been possible to
land.

Fixed by swapping the two lines: `editingEngraving = editing;` now runs
*before* `window.mouseMode = ...`, so `keepWantingRelativeMouse` sees
the correct, already-updated flag when it fires. `make fmt lint check
test` clean again. Still not exercised in the browser — the fix is
reasoned from `hxd.Window.js.hx`'s own source (read in full to confirm
`set_mouseMode`'s call order), not observed working, so treat this as
higher-confidence-but-still-unverified rather than closed.

## 2026-08-10 — Pentagon engraving now glows, translucent

Reported after the cursor fix landed and the interface was actually
playable: no visual clue what the composing mode was even showing —
the first cut drew `buildEngraving`'s two buckets as opaque flat fills
(`addFloorMesh`), on-cells full-brightness `Colours.CONWAY_TILE_GLIDER`
amber, off-cells a dim `Colours.CONWAY_WALL_GLOW` (cyan, an unrelated
hue). Asked directly for cells to "light up... in amber, a bit
translucent, well, as usual" — "as usual" read as this biome's own
existing convention for anything alive: `addLifecycleMesh`'s alpha
blend at `LIVE_BLOCK_OPACITY`, already used for live cells and
walls/ghost walls. `buildEngraving` now calls `addLifecycleMesh` for
both buckets instead of `addFloorMesh` — on-cells full-brightness amber,
off-cells the *same* amber scaled by `ENGRAVING_OFF_BRIGHTNESS` (was
scaling `CONWAY_WALL_GLOW`, the mismatched cyan) — one glowing hue
family across the whole footprint rather than two unrelated colors.
`make fmt lint check test` clean.

## 2026-08-10 — Fixed: the engraving wasn't rendering at all

The translucency fix above didn't fix the actual bug — a screenshot
showed "no visual clue whatsoever," a flat unlit pentagon with no
amber cells at all, not merely a legibility problem.

Root cause was `GeodesicConwayBiome.cameraOverride` dollying the
composing camera the wrong way. This sphere is walked from its
*interior*; `SphereMath.upVectorAt`'s own doc is explicit that "up" for
a point on the surface is the direction *back toward the center*, not
the plain outward radial `worldPositionOf(pentagonId).normalized()`
gives. `cameraOverride` used that outward direction to dolly in,
putting the camera on the far side of the floor mesh from the hollow
interior it should look out from — and because `ENGRAVING_LIFT` (`0.5`)
pulls the engraving further toward the center than the floor's own
`TILE_LIFT` (`0.03`), the misplaced camera had the opaque floor sitting
*nearer* it than the engraving on every ray. Not dim, not occluded at
the edges — fully hidden behind an opaque mesh, every time, hence "no
visual clue whatsoever" rather than "hard to see."

Fixed by dollying inward (`center.normalized().scaled(-1)`) instead —
puts the camera back on the interior side, where `ENGRAVING_LIFT` being
the larger offset now correctly makes the engraving the *nearer* layer,
reading as a raised plaque above the floor. `interact`'s own `up` (used
only for `tangentProject`'s screen-up capture, direction-symmetric so
functionally unaffected either way) flipped to match, so the class
doesn't carry two silently-inverted "up" conventions side by side.
`make fmt lint check test` clean. Still not confirmed in the browser —
the previous two fixes in this space were each individually reasoned
correct and each still missed something a real screenshot caught; this
one specifically wants a look before trusting it either.

## 2026-08-10 — Fixed: clicking anywhere only ever toggled the pentagon

Screenshots after the camera fix landed: the engraving now renders (the
glow/translucency fix was real), but clicking anywhere in view only
ever changed the *pentagon's own* color, never whichever hex was
actually clicked.

Root cause was `h3d.col.Sphere.rayIntersection`, used unmodified in
`onEditClick`. That stock method only ever returns the *near* root of
the ray-sphere quadratic, which is negative — and gets silently
clamped to `0` — whenever the ray's own origin sits *inside* the
sphere. The corrected `cameraOverride` from the entry above dollies the
composing camera toward the sphere's center, to radius
`GeodesicMesh.RADIUS - ENGRAVING_VIEW_HEIGHT` — always inside
`GeodesicMesh.RADIUS`, by construction, once that fix landed. So every
click's own ray resolved to `t = 0`, i.e. `ray.getPoint(0)` = the
camera's own eye position — and because the dolly moves straight along
the pentagon's own radius from the origin, that eye position shares the
pentagon's own *direction*, which `fineLookup.nodeAt` (direction-only,
ignores magnitude) then always resolved back to the pentagon node,
regardless of where the click actually landed on screen.

New `GeodesicConwayBiome.raySphereIntersection` replaces the stock call:
picks the far root when the ray origin is inside the sphere, the near
one when it's outside, rather than assuming either. `make fmt lint
check test` clean.

Also confirmed, not changed: entering an already-composed pentagon
starts from its own persisted pattern (`GeodesicPentagonEngraving.patterns`
is never cleared on exit), blank only the first time a given pentagon
is touched — asked about directly, already the existing behavior once
the click-resolution bug above stopped masking it.

## 2026-08-10 — Widened the pentagon footprint to 3 hops

Asked directly, now that composing actually worked end to end: "a wider
range of config, say, three cells radius." `GeodesicPentagonEngraving`'s
1-ring footprint (`[pentagonId].concat(sphere.neighbors[pentagonId])`,
6 nodes) becomes a real BFS, new `FOOTPRINT_RADIUS = 3` and
`hopNeighborhoodOf` — no ring/radius helper existed anywhere in
`tools.geodesic` before this (checked across the whole package;
`GeodesicVentrellaGliderPattern`'s own `stepToward` walks a fixed
handful of hand-specified hops, not a general neighborhood), so it's a
small BFS of its own.

The 1-ring choice's own doc had argued disjointness from neighboring
pentagons' footprints as the reason to stay narrow — worth actually
checking before widening past it, rather than assuming three hops was
still safe. Wrote a one-off Python BFS over the checked-in baked sphere
(`res/geodesic/conway-sphere.json`) rather than trust the "frequency
11" figure by itself: confirmed the *closest* two of the 12 pentagons
are exactly `11` hops apart, more than three times `2 *
FOOTPRINT_RADIUS` (`6`) — three hops has real headroom before two
pentagons' own footprints could ever touch. `make fmt lint check test`
clean.

## 2026-08-11 — De-pop speedup reverted; dying cells red instead

Asked directly to roll back the previous entry's `DEATH_EASE_SPEEDUP`
change (`git revert`, clean, no conflicts — `GeodesicMesh.buildLiveCells`
back to a plain linear lerp both ways) and replace it with a color
change instead: dying cells red, not a dimmer green.

New `Colours.CONWAY_TILE_DYING` (`0xFFE5484D`), used in
`GeodesicMesh.buildLiveCells`'s dying bucket in place of
`Colours.CONWAY_TILE_LIVE`, `DYING_BRIGHTNESS` dimming still applied on
top exactly as before — only the base hue changed. Flagged in
`CONWAY_TILE_DYING`'s own doc as a deliberate, scoped exception to
`CONWAY_TILE_LIVE`'s own "unicolor cells, dim don't recolor" rule (a
direct quote recorded against `biomes.conway.ConwayMesh`, the older
square-grid biome) — this only recolors `GeodesicMesh`'s own `Dying`
bucket, not a reversal of that earlier call. `make fmt lint check test`
clean.

## 2026-08-11 — Pentagon floor tiles pop out less

Asked directly: pentagons should "pop out less, but still noticeable."
`Colours.CONWAY_TILE_PENTAGON`'s own doc had already flagged itself as
"the single switch" for this exact tuning — a brightness lift off
`CONWAY_TILE_DEAD`, previously roughly `3×` per channel. Dropped to
roughly `1.9×` (`0xFF35566E` → `0xFF1F3240`), closer to the halfway
point between dead and the original lift — no code change needed
beyond the value itself, exactly as that constant's doc anticipated.
`make fmt lint check test` clean.

## 2026-08-11 — Dying cells were lingering across two full generations

Reported directly, screenshot attached: two hexes both still visibly
reddish at once, one freshly dead and one from the generation before,
"about to disappear." Root cause is structural, not a color issue —
`GeodesicMesh.buildLiveCells` lerps every height change across the
whole `STEP_INTERVAL` (`0.75s`), and a cell's own death is genuinely
two such transitions: live height → `GeodesicLifecycle.DYING_BLOCK_HEIGHT`
one generation, then that height → `0` the next. ~1.5s total, by
construction.

Re-added `DEATH_EASE_SPEEDUP` (`2.5`) and the shrinking-eases-faster
logic in `buildLiveCells` — the same mechanism tried and reverted
2026-08-10, but that revert was in favor of trying the
`Colours.CONWAY_TILE_DYING` color change first, not a verdict that the
duration itself was fine; the color change alone didn't address this
report, made it easier to actually see. `GeodesicVentrellaState.step`'s
own rule and `STEP_INTERVAL`'s own cadence remain untouched — this only
changes how quickly a shrinking block's own render height animates
within whichever window it's already in. `make fmt lint check test`
clean.

## 2026-08-11 — Stopped drawing wafer-thin blocks

Asked directly to fix "a brief colour stuttering when a cell is brought
down to a thin layer before disappearing (or when it appears)" — a
second, smaller-scale z-fighting source than the block-vs-floor one
`LIVE_CELL_BASE_LIFT` already fixed: once a live block's own animated
height gets close enough to `0`, its own top and bottom caps nearly
coincide and fight each other instead.

New `GeodesicMesh.MIN_VISIBLE_BLOCK_HEIGHT` (`0.15`, a few times
`LIVE_CELL_BASE_LIFT`'s own `0.04` for real margin): `buildLiveCells`
now skips drawing a block entirely once its own eased height drops
under it, on either end of a growth or shrink animation, rather than
drawing an imperceptibly thin sliver that flickers. Traded a small
pop in/out at the very start/end of the animation for no flicker — a
sliver that thin wasn't reading as "there" anyway.

Broke `GeodesicMeshTest.testBuildLiveCellsDrawsANodeFadingOutEvenThoughItsCurrentStageIsAbsent`:
its own fixed `t = 0.5` sample predates `DEATH_EASE_SPEEDUP` (2026-08-11,
same day) — with that speedup, an `Alive → Absent` shrink (the largest
possible drop) finishes by `t = 0.4`, so `t = 0.5` was sampling *after*
the fade had already completed and stopped drawing, not mid-fade any
more. Moved to `t = 0.1`, comfortably mid-fade regardless. `make fmt
lint check test` clean.

## 2026-08-11 — A whole-game direction, and the theorem under it

Long open-brief session: take the project from prototype toward a real
game, along Garden-of-Eden lines, sculpting with non-euclidean geometry,
several story threads, no menu, Outer Wilds as a lesson rather than a
template, and explicit permission to challenge the oldest directives.
Targets agreed up front: **8-15 hours**, sellable quality bar (destination
undecided), artist and composer hireable, engine choice open.

Output is a new `docs/game/` folder — seven documents,
**proposed, not adopted**. Headlines:

**The three things this project has been carrying separately are one
thing.** A cellular automaton runs on a graph; a graph has a geometry;
and *whether a pattern can exist without a cause depends on which
geometry it runs on*. That is not a metaphor — the Garden of Eden theorem
(Moore/Myhill) holds **if and only if** the group is amenable
(Ceccherini-Silberstein/Machì/Scarabotti, converse by Bartholdi).
Hyperbolic tiling groups are non-amenable, so the theorem fails there:
patterns can exist with no predecessor at all. **Uncaused existence is
available only in negative curvature.** The geodesic CA work, the
non-euclidean brief and the "you are a pattern that outgrew its
automaton" story are the same fact, and the game is the walk down the
curvature scale from a compact amenable sphere to somewhere that cannot
account for you.

**A provable architectural blocker was found.** `Space` represents
position as `h3d.Vector` — a point in ambient ℝ³ — and transports by 3D
rotation; the assumption reaches 53 of 122 source files. Hilbert's
theorem (1901, sharpened by Hilbert–Efimov) says the hyperbolic plane
admits no complete C² isometric immersion in ℝ³. The current
architecture *cannot* represent the direction's most important space, and
no engineering fixes that. Proposed replacement: an intrinsic
curvature-parameterised homogeneous model (one code path, κ as a number,
the way HyperRogue does it), with the spaces as product geometries
S²×ℝ / E²×ℝ / H²×ℝ so the vertical/jump/wall work stays Euclidean.

**The good news is bigger than the bad.** A cellular automaton runs on a
graph and a graph has no curvature, so *all* of the largest investment in
this repo — `GeodesicVentrellaState`, the rules, the lifecycle, the maze
carver, reactivity, the pentagon engraving, the whole glider-search
toolchain — ports to hyperbolic tilings unchanged. Swapping the
icosahedral hex sphere for Margenstern's ternary heptagrid is a different
adjacency list, not a different program. What must be rebuilt is the
spatial/rendering layer, which is smaller and mostly mechanical.

**Engine: stay on Haxe + Heaps, rewrite the spatial core** — argued
rather than assumed, since the brief opened it. Non-euclidean is fully
custom in every engine; large engines actively fight you (culling,
physics, LOD, shadows, navmesh all assume Euclidean); and HxSL's
composable shader fragments are unusually well suited to injecting one
vertex transform into every material. Named revisit trigger recorded so
it does not get relitigated.

**Also proposed:** nine spaces, each teaching one property of its own
geometry; four braided story threads (the ghosts are oscillators — awake,
loopable, unable to learn; the terrain is made of predecessors who
stopped); `BECOME`, a moveset of cellular-automaton bodies each with a
real cost; learning-by-watching as the no-journal answer to knowledge
gating; hue-encodes-curvature as the art spine; the automaton as the
score; and the antagonist being the world *settling* — which is the
disappointment this project already measured in 2026-07-29 turned into a
theme. A beat-by-beat first hour is written as the falsification test.

**The name should change.** `unbegotten` names the prototype's gimmick, and
in this direction the sphere is the starting cage. Recommendation:
**UNBEGOTTEN**, with ORPHAN a close second — the field's own vocabulary
is already theological ("Garden of Eden", "orphan"), so the register is
faithful rather than reaching.

**Honest headline: 3-5 years**, and one existential risk that is testable
in two months — *is walking in hyperbolic space pleasant or nauseating?*
Phase 0 exists solely to answer it, with kill criteria written in advance.
Second, under-appreciated risk flagged: `{7,3}` has three neighbours, so
its two-state rule space is ~256 rules and may contain nothing
interesting — this project has already been burned by exactly that on hex
grids, and the mitigation (more states, as the Ventrella switch already
did) is in hand.

## 2026-08-11 — Phase 0, step 1: the curvature core, built and tested

Rather than leave the direction folder as prose, built the first step of
its own migration plan — the piece everything else is downstream of.

New `src/geometry/`: `Curvature` (the three constant-curvature geometries
as one enum, plus the generalised trigonometry `cosK`/`sinK` that makes
them one code path), `CurvedSpace` (the homogeneous model: the bilinear
form, geodesic distance, normalisation, circle circumference) and
`Isometry` (a 3×3 matrix over model coordinates; the player's entire
spatial state in the proposed architecture).

**No Heaps dependency anywhere in the package**, deliberately — the whole
point is that the geometry is verifiable without a renderer, which is why
this was safe to build first.

`geometry.CurvedSpaceTest` proves it is the genuine article rather than
something merely bendy, and the tests are chosen to be falsifiable:

- **All three laws of cosines**, to `1e-9` — spherical, Euclidean and
  hyperbolic, each with its own closed form. This is the decisive one; a
  near-miss implementation fails it immediately.
- **The sphere's triangle with three right angles closes** — three quarter
  great-circles and three right-angle turns return to the origin. A
  small-angle approximation cannot pass this.
- **Squares fail to close under curvature** but close exactly in flat
  space — holonomy, which is the mechanic `The Defect` biome is built on.
- **Circumference grows exponentially only in hyperbolic space** (r=5→10
  grows by >100×). This is the direction's own thesis expressed as an
  assertion: exponential growth *is* non-amenability, which is why the
  Garden of Eden theorem fails there, which is why uncaused patterns can
  exist there and nowhere else.

44 new assertions, 38,539 total. `make fmt lint check test` clean.

Note for whoever picks this up: `make check` compiles from `Main`, and
nothing in the game references `geometry` yet, so **only `make test`
currently compiles this package**. That is fine for now and worth
remembering — it also means secondary module types need explicit imports
(`import geometry.Curvature.CurvatureMath;`), which the compiler only
told us about once the test pulled it in.

**What this does and does not prove.** It proves the mathematics and the
representation are sound, and that the existing test culture can verify
non-euclidean geometry headlessly — which was the main open question about
whether a rewrite this deep is safely doable here. It proves **nothing**
about whether walking in hyperbolic space is *pleasant*, which remains the
project's one existential risk and still needs the rest of Phase 0: the
HxSL projection fragment and one bare `{7,3}` room to walk.

## 2026-08-11 — Correction: `{7,3}` has seven neighbours, not three

Same session, caught while preparing to spike the risk it describes.
`direction/roadmap.md`'s Risk 2 claimed the ternary heptagrid gives
*three* neighbours per cell and therefore a rule space of only ~256, and
rated that "high, under-appreciated". Wrong: **"ternary" names three tiles
around a vertex**, not three neighbours per cell. A `{7,3}` cell is a
heptagon and has **seven** edge-neighbours.

The correction reverses the conclusion. Seven neighbours give an
outer-totalistic rule space of ~65,536 — *larger* than the hex sphere's
~16,384, so on rule-space size the heptagrid is more promising than what
the game already runs on, not less. Risk 2 drops from high to medium.

A real risk does survive, restated: a large rule space does not imply
interesting life (this project already found zero confirmed travellers
across 2166 hex candidates), and hyperbolic neighbourhoods grow
exponentially with radius, so a pattern's influence disperses much faster
than on a flat or spherical grid. The open question is not "is the rule
space big enough" but "do compact, persistent, translating structures
exist at all in negative curvature" — still worth spiking early, no
longer a plausible project-killer.

Corrected in three places (`roadmap.md`, `architecture.md`,
`systems.md` — the last two also said 3). The wrong version is left
visible in `roadmap.md` behind a correction note rather than quietly
overwritten: a risk register that silently rewrites itself is not one you
can trust, and the same discipline this log already applies to gameplay
corrections applies to design documents.

## 2026-08-11 — The heptagrid, generated and measured (Risk 2's spike)

Ran the headless half of Phase 0's second spike rather than leaving it
scheduled. New `geometry.HyperbolicTiling` generates a finite patch of any
regular hyperbolic tiling `{p,q}` as an **adjacency graph**, which is the
only thing a cellular automaton needs — and is therefore the first real
consumer of the curvature core, confirming it is useful rather than merely
correct.

**Confirms the correction above empirically.** `{7,3}` interior faces have
**seven** neighbours, by construction and by test. `{5,4}` — the named
fallback substrate — gives five. Both generate cleanly.

**A real bug, caught by measuring rather than by testing.** The first
construction gave ring populations of exactly `1, 7, 49, 343, 2401` — that
is `7ⁿ`, a perfect 7-ary tree, meaning welding never merged anything and
the "tiling" was not a tiling at all. Cause: a child's generator set was
not oriented to walk *back* to its parent, because for odd `p` none of the
`p` directions `k·2π/p` is ever exactly `π`. Nothing reconverged, so
nothing welded. Fixed by composing a half-turn onto each generator, so
generator 0 becomes the inverse of the step that arrived.

Worth recording that **the tests passed while the construction was
wrong** — they asserted "each ring is larger than the last", which a tree
satisfies enthusiastically. Replaced with exact assertions: the known
sequence `1, 7, 21, 56, 147, 385`, and the growth rate converging on
**φ² ≈ 2.618** (the golden ratio squared — the known growth rate of these
tilings, and a fact the implementation cannot accidentally satisfy).

That growth rate is the direction's own thesis as a measured number:
each step outward multiplies available space by a constant factor above
one, forever, which is what non-amenability means concretely.

39,779 assertions total. `make fmt lint check test` clean.

**Still not answered:** whether any rule on this tiling produces compact
persistent travelling structures. The tiling and the harness now exist, so
that search is a follow-up rather than a research project — but it has not
been run, and Risk 2 stays open until it has.

## 2026-08-11 — Ran the rule probe: two findings, one changes the build order

Full write-up in
[`docs/building/notes/hyperbolic-simulation-findings.md`](../building/notes/hyperbolic-simulation-findings.md).

**Finding 1 — `{7,3}` sustains life easily.** 972 sampled outer-totalistic
rules survived 120 generations without dying out or saturating, dozens
churning every single generation. A markedly better starting position than
the hex sphere, where soup evaporated and 2166 candidates yielded zero
travellers. Intuition: seven neighbours plus exponential neighbourhood
growth widen the knife-edge between extinction and explosion. Travelling
structures are still unsearched, so Risk 2 narrows rather than closes.

**Finding 2 — a finite hyperbolic patch is mostly boundary, and gets worse
with size.** The patch used had 617 faces of which only 85 were far enough
from the edge to score — 14%. Adding rings makes the ratio *worse*, since
ring populations grow by φ² forever. This is the isoperimetric character
of hyperbolic space arriving as an engineering constraint, and it is the
same fact the design keeps calling "everywhere is edge": there is no scale
at which a hyperbolic region's boundary becomes negligible.

The fix is to simulate on a **compact** hyperbolic surface rather than a
patch — no boundary at all, by construction. The design already contains
one: **The Knot**, the genus-2 surface, filed as a late-game exotic space.
So this promotes it from "good biome" to "the technically correct
substrate", and **may invert the build order** — The Knot before The
Sprawl. Flagged in `roadmap.md` as a real ordering decision rather than
folded in silently, since it contradicts the phases as written.

Honest caveat recorded with it: the amenability argument is about
*infinite* groups, so on a compact surface the strict theorem applies to
the universal cover, not to the finite thing being simulated. What
survives is the *felt* geometry. The fiction should not claim more rigour
than the object has.

## 2026-08-12 — Self-review of the direction: one central error, three overclaims

Asked to review the previous session's own work, judge it and improve it.
It did not survive intact.

**The thesis was wrong.** `direction/README.md` headlined *"uncaused
existence is available only in negative curvature"*. That is **false**.
Gardens of Eden exist in flat space — Conway's Life on ℤ² has had known
orphans since 1971, smallest 136 cells — and ℤ² is amenable. The claim
contradicted one of the most famous results in the field, and it was the
first bold sentence in the folder.

What the Garden of Eden theorem actually says, on an amenable group, is
that orphans exist **if and only if** the rule erases something
(surjective ⟺ pre-injective). So there, uncaused things and destroyed
things are the same fact counted twice. On a non-amenable group that
equivalence *fails*: a rule can be pre-injective but not surjective, so
orphans exist **without anything being erased**.

Corrected sentence: **in an amenable world, to be uncaused, something must
have been erased; in a non-amenable world, you can be uncaused for free.**
Freedom is available everywhere — negative curvature only changes whether
it has a victim.

**The correction improves the game**, which is the argument for taking the
mathematics seriously rather than decoratively. The false version gave a
destination; the true version gives a moral problem. Ending 1 stops being
"reach the exit" and becomes "refuse a price you could have made someone
else pay". The Gardener's ambiguity resolves: she took the cheap route,
erased someone, and built the Fold afterwards as an apology — derivable
from the theorem rather than told. Thread 2 (the ghosts, the still lifes)
stops being atmosphere and becomes the argument. The world map is
unchanged.

**Three overclaims also corrected:**

- *"That assumption reaches 53 of 122 source files"* conflated *mentions
  `h3d.Vector`* with *depends on the ℝ³ embedding*. Measured properly: 54
  mention it, **41 do spatial reasoning** and are genuinely affected, 16
  are mesh builders that mostly survive. Honest figure ~40, more
  concentrated than stated.
- *"UNBEGOTTEN has essentially zero competition"* was asserted without
  looking. There is a 2016 TV movie and a 1984 Lin Carter story. No games,
  so the recommendation stands, but it is not uncontested.
- The `{7,3}` rule probe's *"972 rules survived, sustains life easily"*
  was stated with more confidence than an 85-cell scored region and a
  single soup seed can carry. Downgraded to "promising enough to justify
  the real experiment", with the three caveats written out.

Also noted: **AMENABLE gets stronger as a title under the correction** —
amenability is precisely the property that makes freedom expensive.

Errors left visible behind correction notes rather than quietly
overwritten, same discipline as the `{7,3}` neighbour-count fix.

## 2026-08-12 — The Weft corrected: paired walls on an ordinary sphere, not a quotient

Caught in conversation, not by review this time. Asked to walk through
the Weft's design; picked **remove/add, opposite** as its wall verb; then
asked what the player's own antipodal image should physically do if a
wall closes at its far location. That question had no good answer under
what `world-and-threads.md` actually described — "the projective plane,
walkable", a genuine quotient manifold with points literally identified.
A true quotient has exactly one wall per identified edge, so "opposite"
has nothing to be opposite *to*, and there is no second body to ask the
physicality question of in the first place.

Rewrote the entry around the model that actually supports the chosen
verb: an ordinary sphere, no manifold trick, wall pairs linked by an
authored rule (open here → closed there). The player has one body and one
collision check, always. What appears at the antipode is a non-solid
**reflection** — pure rendering, no physics — so "phase through a closed
gate" isn't a bug to prevent, it's the reflection working as intended, and
it doubles as the mechanic's own tutorial: watch your echo glide through
a gate the instant you close yours, and you've watched the "opposite" rule
happen rather than been told about it. Kept one beat from the original
pitch at near-zero cost: walking toward your own reflection and
"arriving" can be staged to feel like coming home, without the manifold
that used to be required to produce that feeling.

Error left visible behind a correction note, same discipline as the
thesis correction — this one caught by the question itself proving
unanswerable, which is usually the first sign a design has quietly
committed to two incompatible models at once.

## 2026-08-12 — The Repeat rebuilt around a mechanism, not a mood

Asked directly for "riddles and tricks, not a contemplative game" — the
first pass gave the Repeat a legibility law (learn the period, discount
the echoes) but nothing to *do*. Rebuilt in conversation, converging on
two of four floated options (deliberately breaking symmetry to open a
door; marking your own tile as ground truth) getting dropped in favour of
a synthesis of the other two: spot pre-existing divergence, and let
finding it be the unlock rather than a separate step.

Same geometric reframe the Weft needed, for the same reason: a true
quotient (one simulated region, rendered by wraparound) leaves nothing to
compare, so this space needs the looser model too — many separately
simulated tiles, kept identical only by determinism (same seed, same
rule, same future, unless something intervened).

The mechanism: walk one measured period, compare the tile you're in
against the one you remember, and treat any difference as a door — the
divergence itself is standable/reachable ground the reference tile
doesn't have, so recognising it and reaching it are the same act, not two
steps. Solve a handful of tiles and the individual differences stop
reading as noise and compose into a **mark that isn't the player's own** —
reusing `MarkModel`/`entities.painting` rendering rather than inventing
new geometry, and cross-linked to the existing "someone messes with the
marks" backlog entry so the reveal has somewhere to plug into rather than
landing as an isolated cutscene.

Story payoff: the game's first hard evidence, this early, that the player
isn't the first pattern here — Thread 2 material, planted before the
ghosts or ravens make it explicit. Loneliness beat kept, sharpened rather
than discarded: most of the space really is alone; the proof that some of
it isn't is now something the player builds themselves out of checkable
facts, not something they're told.

Not flagged as a correction (unlike the Weft) — the original entry wasn't
wrong, it was underbuilt. Worth noting: this makes the Repeat a much
stronger candidate for the roadmap's core-five cut than it was when the
recommendation to defer it was written; not revisited here, left for
whoever owns that call.

## 2026-08-12 — Per-biome visual dialect, and the Repeat's first one

Asked directly for graphical variation from one biome to the next, beyond
hue-encodes-curvature — "very low level design, nearly no texture, only
geometric shapes." New "Per-biome visual dialect" section in
`art-and-audio.md`: hue and the material language stay universal
constants (they're what makes the whole system teach anything), and each
space additionally gets its own silhouette dialect on top, argued from
what that space teaches rather than assigned by taste.

First entry: **the Repeat as a low-poly cell city**, Manifold Garden's own
register. Not just a palette pick — it reinforces the space's own
mechanism from the same day's earlier rebuild: a city's hard edges and
repeated units give divergence somewhere obvious to hide (a mis-lit
window, an extra storey, a rooftop one degree off), in a way organic
terrain doesn't offer for free. Cross-linked both directions between
`world-and-threads.md`'s Repeat entry and the new table.

## 2026-08-12 — The Turn: chirality kept but unresolved, locomotion flagged as its own risk

Discussed and recorded rather than settled. The chirality-routing
mechanism (loop parity determines a glider's handedness; deliberately
route the opposite to annihilate a blocking one) stays, but explicitly
**not sold on the setup** — how the player cheaply discovers their own
current state without the discovery itself becoming the boring part.
Marks-as-reference is the leading candidate, not a decision.

Separately, and judged the harder problem: this space specifically
requires walking its own loop *more than once*, on purpose, which is a
much higher repetition tolerance than anything else in the set asks for.
Raised directly, with a named reference (*Race the Sun*, where tuned
traversal alone carries a whole game): either locomotion here has to be
that good on its own, or every lap needs its own improvable skill so
repetition reads as practice rather than backtracking. Neither built.
Added as Risk 9 in `roadmap.md`, distinguished from Risk 8 (whether
`BECOME`'s bodies are fun at all) — this one is about whether *this one
space's own* repetition budget survives regardless of that answer.

Also formally set aside the backlog's "one side affects the other"
(mirror-paired walls across the strip) for this space specifically — same
spatial-pairing shape the Weft and the Repeat already cover; keeping the
Turn about a travelling pattern's own history is what keeps it distinct
from both.

## 2026-08-12 — The Defect worked out: a continuous dial, not a coin flip

Written up as discussed, no coherence issue this time — a cone point's
holonomy is sound, textbook Gauss-Bonnet, unlike the Weft's original
claim. What was missing was the mechanism, goal and gain, now added.

The distinction from the Turn that keeps both spaces earning their place:
the Turn's chirality is binary (flipped or not); the Defect's rotation is
**continuous and composable** — loop the same defect twice for double the
angle, combine defects of different angles, and you have an actual dial.
The goal it drives is a socket that only accepts a carried pattern at one
exact orientation, deliberately with **no in-place editing tool** (unlike
the Fold's pentagon engraving) — the orientation has to already be
correct on arrival, set by how the player routed beforehand. That
absence is the mechanical version of the story beat: the Fold's sockets
are the convenience version of what this space makes you do the hard way.

Meta-gain kept from the original entry and sharpened: this is where the
player learns *why* the Fold's twelve pentagons are cone points at all
(Euler's formula forces exactly twelve on that tiling) — a retroactive
payoff over a mechanic they already spent hours using, not new
information about a new place.

Corrected one overclaim from the original entry in the same pass: "nearly
free to implement" undersold the work. `CurvedSpace`/`Isometry` (built
this week) only cover the three uniform-curvature geometries; a cone
point is curvature concentrated at a single spot in an otherwise flat
plane, a different, unbuilt construction. `MobiusSpace`'s own seam
handling (wrap the parameter, apply a transform on crossing it) is a real
precedent for the shape of that work, not a shortcut around doing it.
Left both the original "cheap" claim and the correction visible, same
discipline as every other pass today.

## 2026-08-12 — The Sprawl: not the exterior of anything, and the algorithm made concrete

Asked directly what geometric object the Sprawl actually is — a real
question, since "exterior of a sphere" would be a category error:
curvature is a property of the surface itself, not which side you stand
on, and the sphere's exterior is already a different, already-built,
still-amenable biome (`SphereExteriorSpace`). Clarified with the
heptagon-vs-hexagon-vs-pentagon material-count intuition (7 × ~64° ≈ 449°
per vertex, too much to lie flat, so the surface ruffles outward forever
instead of closing) and the standard hyperbolic-crochet/coral/lettuce-leaf
image. Also noted honestly: a regular `{7,3}` tiling has no forced
defects, unlike the Fold's twelve pentagons — no natural landmark to
anchor on, which is exactly why navigation has to be algorithmic.

`systems.md`'s own knowledge-web entry has said since the first pass that
"the algorithm is demonstrated by a raven's flight path" without ever
saying what it demonstrates. Made concrete: the problem genuinely has two
components. **Radius** by ring-counting — real, tested code
(`geometry.HyperbolicTiling`'s BFS, φ² growth measured in the findings
note), not a proposal; watching a raven long enough teaches the same
skill that works in the Sprawl, since it's the same graph-BFS fact either
place. **Bearing** — the part that actually needs a trick — reuses the
Sprawl's own audio direction, already written in `art-and-audio.md`, by
turning its "density rises with distance" atmosphere into an instrument:
a consistent pulse at ring boundaries, carried by ear while sight is
occupied with the illegible near field. Cross-linked in both directions
between the world doc and the audio doc rather than duplicated.

The "treasure map" idea, kept diegetic rather than a UI: reuses the
Repeat's own evidence-assembly mechanic outright — a predecessor's
solution, left as fragments, each legible only once the player has
already proven they can read one. Deliberately not a new system; the same
skill built two spaces ago, paying off again.

## 2026-08-12 — Phase 0 built: a walkable {7,3} room, awaiting the playtest

Asked to refactor per `architecture.md` and implement all nine spaces.
Declined that scope and said why: Phase 0's kill question ("is walking in
hyperbolic space pleasant or nauseating?") is a *playtest* question this
environment cannot answer, three of the nine spaces have no settled
mechanism (the Turn's locomotion, the Ribbon entirely, the Knot partly),
and the refactor would break a working game before the direction is
validated. Agreed instead to build Phase 0 properly.

**New, all headless and tested:** `geometry.HyperbolicProjection` (the
Beltrami-Klein projection — bearing exact, distance compressed to `tanh`,
so the whole infinite plane fits inside a unit disk and "see near, not
far" arrives out of correct maths rather than authoring) and
`geometry.HyperbolicWalker` (tracks the *view* isometry rather than the
player's frame, so movement never inverts a matrix — which is exactly
where precision would go, since boost entries grow exponentially with
distance). `HyperbolicTiling` gained per-face `frames`, needed by anything
drawing faces rather than simulating on them. 13 new assertions, 39,813
total.

**Deliberately CPU-side, not HxSL.** `architecture.md` recommends a shader
fragment for the shipping renderer and that is still right — but a shader
cannot be verified here, whereas the arithmetic can. Doing the maths in
tested Haxe first means a wrong-looking room is a plumbing bug rather
than an unverifiable shader. Port once the room is confirmed.

**The harness:** `tools.hyperbolic.HyperbolicWalkApp`, `walk.hxml`,
`walk.html`, `make walk`. Standalone on the `GeodesicPreview` precedent —
shares no code path with `Main`/`GameLoop`, implements no `Biome`, so a
Phase 0 answer of "no" costs one file and the working game is never at
risk while the question is open. No art, no simulation, no goal, on
purpose: adding any would make a bad answer ambiguous.

**Verified by screenshot** (allowed per `CLAUDE.md`, unlike input): the
room renders correctly — heptagonal floor with visible seams, amber home
spire at the origin, columns crowding toward a horizon that is the
*actual* horizon (at eye height 1.7 the far floor sits ~9.7° below eye
level) rather than a cull edge.

**Two findings worth keeping:**

1. **First render was flat orange** — the home spire stands at face 0,
   which is also where the camera spawned, so the view was the inside of
   the marker. Fixed with a two-cell spawn offset, which also makes
   `distanceFromOrigin` read as "how far from the thing I can see".
2. **The browser pane cannot size a Heaps canvas, and this is
   pre-existing.** `window.innerWidth` reports `0` inside its iframe, so
   Heaps falls back to a 16×16 canvas and writes it as an *inline* style
   that overrides the page CSS. Confirmed the **existing game's own
   `index.html` has exactly the same 16×16 canvas here**, so this is
   environmental, not something the harness introduced — and it is a
   large part of why visual verification in this environment has always
   been so unrewarding. Worked around for screenshots by setting the
   canvas size from `document.documentElement.clientHeight` and firing a
   resize. No source change: the same HTML works in a real browser.

**Still unverified, and it is the whole point:** motion and comfort.
`make walk` and ten minutes of walking is the gate on everything else in
`direction/`. Get other people to try it too — motion tolerance varies
enormously and a sample of one is not a sample.

## 2026-08-12 — Hyperbolic walking VALIDATED; Risk 8's harness built

**Phase 0's first existential question is answered: yes.** Walking in
hyperbolic space was played and confirmed tolerable. The direction's
biggest risk is retired — comfort now demotes from "might kill this
project" to a standing design constraint. Everything downstream of that
assumption in `direction/` is unblocked.

**Phase 0 is not finished, though**, and the reason is written into the
roadmap: Risk 8 (`BECOME` may not be fun) was rated existential and
explicitly moved *into* Phase 0 — "three bodies on flat ground, ten
minutes, before any world is designed around it." Six of the nine spaces
assume it. None of it had been played. So that harness got built rather
than skipping ahead to Phase 1.

**`tools.become.BecomeModel`** — headless, pure, 17 assertions. Four
bodies: `Walker` (the control), `Glider` (translates continuously, **has
no input term at all** so it genuinely cannot be stopped, turns queued
and applied on the beat), `Oscillator` (motionless between beats, hops on
them) and `StillLife` (cannot translate, can still look — perception is
not movement). A global beat drives all of it, and **switching bodies
costs a beat** with nothing moving during it, taken straight from
`systems.md` and modelled rather than skipped precisely because it is the
part most likely to feel bad.

Tests pin the *rules*, which is as far as tests can reach: a glider
advances with no input and cannot be halted by reverse input; its turns
land on the beat and are buffered rather than dropped; an oscillator
doesn't drift between beats; a still life never translates; stopping a
glider genuinely requires becoming something else; a long frame still
drains its beats. Whether any of that is *fun* is the open question and
only a person with the harness can answer it.

**`tools.become.BecomeApp`** (`make become`) — flat Euclidean hex field,
columns for parallax, the whole field lifting slightly as each beat
approaches so the boundary can be anticipated rather than surprising.
Flat on purpose: curvature is separately validated now, and testing both
at once would make a bad answer ambiguous.

Verified by screenshot only (renders correctly, proper linear flat-space
horizon — a useful contrast against the hyperbolic harness's compressed
rim). Input still cannot be delivered in this environment, so the feel is
unplayed.

Third standalone harness now, all on the `GeodesicPreview` precedent:
`make walk`, `make become`, none of them touching the real game.

## 2026-08-12 — Fixed: `make walk`/`make become` served the game instead

Reported immediately on trying the harness: "looks like the same debug
hub as usual." It was — both targets served the whole of `bin/`, where
`index.html` is the *game*, so the bare `http://localhost:8081` /
`:8082` handed back the real game and the harness only appeared at an
explicit `/walk.html` or `/become.html` path.

A footgun worth removing rather than documenting around: the wrong URL
silently returned something plausible, so it looked like the harness had
been built wrong rather than like the wrong page had loaded.

Each harness now builds into its **own directory** (`bin/walk/`,
`bin/become/`) with its page as that directory's `index.html`, and the
server is rooted there — so the bare URL *is* the harness and the game is
not reachable from that port at all (verified: `game.js` 404s on 8082).
Both targets also now print the URL and controls in a banner before
starting the server.

## 2026-08-12 — Phase 0 harnesses: AZERTY-broken input, fixed

Reported on trying `make become`: keyboard trouble on AZERTY, and a
suspicion the digits would be affected too. Both correct, and both my
bug — this project had already solved the problem and I did not use the
solution.

`game.PhysicalKeys` has existed for exactly this since the movement work:
it tracks keys by physical `KeyboardEvent.code`, so `"KeyW"` is whatever
sits in QWERTY's W position regardless of layout, and `game.Keybinds`
binds the game's own strafe/forward through it. Both harnesses instead
used `hxd.Key.W/A/S/D` and `hxd.Key.NUMBER_1..4`, which are
layout-*labelled* — so on AZERTY movement landed on the wrong physical
keys, and the digit row (`&é"'` unshifted) could not select a body at
all.

**The game itself was never affected**: its only letter binds are `E`,
`L` and `P`, which sit in the same position on both layouts, and its
movement already went through `PhysicalKeys`.

`PhysicalKeys` only had `isDown`, so it gained **`isPressed`** — needed
for the body-switch and turn-queue keys. Two details worth keeping:

- **Idempotent within a frame**, keyed on `hxd.Timer.frameCount`. The
  obvious version (return the pending flag, clear it) would let the first
  caller in a frame see a press and every later caller miss it — a trap
  that stays invisible until a second reader of the same key appears.
- **The answer is frame-stamped, not the keydown.** A DOM keydown fires
  *between* frames, so the frame number at press time is ambiguous;
  the frame at read time never is.
- Auto-repeat keydown is ignored unless the key genuinely transitioned,
  so holding a key is one press, not a stream.

Both harnesses now route every key through `PhysicalKeys`, arrows
included, so there is one input path rather than two.

## 2026-08-12 — Phase 0 harnesses: left/right were mirrored

Reported straight after the AZERTY fix: "left is right and right is
left." Correct, in both harnesses, and from a single cause this project
had already hit once and documented — **Heaps' camera is left-handed**
(`s3d.camera.rightHanded == false`), so its on-screen right is the
*opposite* of the right-handed `forward.cross(up)`. `game.GameLoop`'s own
strafe code carries a long comment about exactly this. I mapped heading
to `(cos, sin)`, which is right-handed, and so turning, strafing **and**
mouse-look all came out mirrored together.

Verified analytically before touching anything (a throwaway script
computing `-(forward × up)` against the strafe direction and against
`d(forward)/dheading`): negating the Z component fixes all three at once,
because all three are the same error.

Fixed at the boundary rather than per-input, one place each:

- **`BecomeModel.dirX`/`dirZ`** — new shared helpers with the `-sin` on Z,
  used by movement *and* by the camera, so the world and the view can
  never disagree about which way forward is.
- **`HyperbolicProjection.toWorld`** — negates Z at the model-to-render
  boundary, which is where a renderer-handedness concern belongs.
- **`HyperbolicWalker.strafe`** now commits to *positive is right* rather
  than its previous "sign picks the side", so the convention is stated
  once instead of rediscovered at every call site.

**The real lesson is the tests.** Every existing test passed while the
controls were mirrored, because they were all sign-agnostic — distances
and magnitudes, never a side. Three tests added that derive screen-right
independently (`-(forward × up)`) rather than restating the
implementation, and **all three were confirmed to fail against the old
behaviour** before being kept: `testStrafingGoesToScreenRight`,
`testTurningRightSweepsTheWorldToScreenLeft`,
`testStrafingRightLeavesTheOriginOnYourLeft`. 39,841 assertions.

## 2026-08-12 — BECOME cut after playtest; the Ascent becomes the Reconstruction

Phase 0's second existential risk came back **negative**, and the verdict
went further than the kill criterion anticipated. Not "the bodies need
tuning" but: *"I don't think the player will find it fun to become a
glider. Rather, let's say we are a cell that evolved further ahead. We
will still play around and discover the basic rules, states and patterns,
but only to retroactively understand what we are and how we came to be.
But let's not replay the early days."* Plus, on switching: **"switching at
all is the wrong verb."**

**Two of my own errors made the harness harsher than the idea deserved**,
recorded so the next spike avoids them:

1. **All three bodies were strictly worse than the walker** I put beside
   them as a control. The glider was *slower* than walking and could not
   stop — I had even written that its advantage was "commitment and
   reach, never raw pace", then gave it no reach and no advantage. So the
   test offered one dominant option and three punishments.
2. **It tested them kinesthetically in a world with no rules.**
   `systems.md`'s own case for the bodies was always *relational* —
   barriers opening on a period, terrain that needs a platform. None
   existed in the harness, so switching cost a beat and bought literally
   nothing.

The result stands regardless, and the replacement is better and simpler.

**What changed, agreed in the same conversation:**

- **`BECOME` is cut.** Verb count 8 → 7. The harness is deleted (git
  history keeps it); `game.PhysicalKeys.isPressed`, added for it, stays
  since `make walk` uses it.
- **You are already past the primitives.** Gliders, oscillators and still
  lifes stay everywhere and stay central, but as *subject matter*, not
  costumes. The inversion: **primitive life is subject to the rule; you
  operate it.**
- **Thread 1: The Ascent → The Reconstruction.** Not a climb, an
  archaeology. Each primitive form understood is a recovered piece of
  your own origin, and the last thing reconstructed is that the chain
  *does not reach you*.
- **This makes Thread 2 land much harder.** If you are past those rungs
  and everything you meet is stuck on one, the world is not a tutorial —
  it is a **graveyard of arrested development**, and the terrain is made
  of the ones who stopped.
- **Progression = knowledge + perception unlocks** (chosen over
  knowledge-only and over instruments). Retroactive by nature, and it
  finally gives the backlog's own "retroactive rediscovery via a gained
  sense" entry a home in the spine rather than as a loose idea.
- **The no-journal answer improved:** was "your body is the log", now
  **"the world is the log"** — because progression is perception,
  everything understood is visible outward. Nothing to display even in
  principle.
- **Movement: free and modern**, plus one or two *permanent* traversal
  abilities, never modal.

**`first-hour.md`'s two closing beats rewritten.** Minute 42-52 was the
gap that forced a body swap; it is now a **return** — you walk back past
somewhere already visited and it reads differently because *you* changed,
which teaches the game's real progression grammar the old version never
did. And the reveal stops being "I am one too" (five cells, same as the
glider) and becomes **"what am I, then?"** — you pull back and find
yourself enormous and intricate beside the simple blinking things you
spent an hour learning to read. The hour now ends on the question that
runs the game rather than on an answer.

**Phase 0 is complete.** One risk validated, one killed cheaply. That is
exactly the outcome the phase was designed to produce, and it cost one
harness rather than a year of building a world around an untested core.

## 2026-08-12 — The spatial refactor is far smaller than architecture.md claimed

Asked to start the refactor rather than build more harnesses. Surveyed
the blast radius first, and two findings collapsed most of it.

**Finding 1: `Space` has exactly one consumer.** All `space.upAt` /
`space.moveAlong` calls are inside `PlayerModel`. Every other file reads
`player.pos` / `forward` / `surfaceUp`. So the abstraction is fully
encapsulated and can be changed — or extended — without touching the 22
files that read player state.

**Finding 2, the important one: the "provable blocker" was overstated,
and I proved it by building past it.** `architecture.md`'s headline
technical fact was that `Space` *cannot* hold hyperbolic space, because
Hilbert's theorem forbids an isometric embedding of H² in ℝ³. The theorem
is right; the conclusion conflated an **isometric embedding** with a
**coordinate model**. `Space`'s signature never says `h3d.Vector` means
an ambient Euclidean point — it says three floats, and those can be
hyperboloid coordinates on `⟨p,p⟩ = -1` under the Minkowski form, which
is an intrinsic and singularity-free description of H² in exactly three
numbers.

The tell was there the whole time: **`SphereSpace`'s own `pos` is a unit
3-vector, and unit 3-vectors *are* the natural model of S²** rather than
an embedding of it. `GeodesicLookup` has been doing intrinsic spherical
geometry since it was written. Hyperbolic is the same trick with one sign
flipped.

New `biomes.common.space.hyperbolic.HyperbolicSpace` implements the
**existing, unmodified `Space` interface**: `moveAlong` is a Lorentz
boost with the same structure as `SphereSpace`'s rotation (circular
functions swapped for hyperbolic ones, `forward` split into its
along-direction component and an untouched perpendicular remainder), and
`upAt` returns render-space up — correct rather than a fudge, since the
game's spaces are products (H²×ℝ) and height is not expressible in the
three surface coordinates. `FlatSpace` already returns a constant for the
same reason.

Seven tests, including **agreement with `geometry.CurvedSpace`** — two
implementations written days apart landing on the same number, which is
stronger evidence than either passing its own suite. Also re-checks
holonomy through the `Space` interface so a bug here cannot hide behind
correct primitives elsewhere. 39,927 assertions, `make fmt lint check
test` clean, and the existing game is untouched.

**What is genuinely still required**, now that the scope is honest:
hyperbolic collision and mesh building are new code (they cannot reuse
ℝ³ distance), and gravity written against `upAt` needs to know it is
getting render-space up. That is a real but ordinary body of work — not
a rewrite of the spatial core.

## 2026-08-16 — The Sprawl becomes a real biome

The hyperbolic plane is walkable in the game rather than in a standalone
harness (`biomes.sprawl.SprawlBiome`), and shows up in the debug hub's
portal ring on its own, since that ring is derived from the registry.

Three pieces, in the order they had to happen.

**`HyperbolicView`** bridges the two representations of hyperbolic
position the project ended up with: `geometry.Isometry` stores a frame
as a matrix, `PlayerModel` stores a `pos`/`forward` pair. One place
converts, so nobody re-derives it per rendering site. The inverse is the
Minkowski adjoint (`J·Mᵀ·J`) rather than general 3×3 inversion — exact,
no division, and no conditioning problem on a boost whose entries grow
exponentially with distance.

**Two seams, both corrections to the previous entry's claims.** The
claim that hyperbolic space needed no interface change held for
everything `Space` covered — and turning was not one of those things.
`PlayerModel.turn` was an inline `rotateAroundAxis(forward, surfaceUp,
angle)`: correct wherever model coordinates *are* ambient ℝ³, and
meaningless in hyperboloid coordinates, where `upAt` returns
render-space up. Same for `rightVector`, used to strafe. Both moved into
`Space`; the four ambient spaces share one implementation
(`AmbientFrame`) holding the exact expressions moved out, so they are
unchanged by construction.

Separately, `Biome.cameraOverride` returning non-null meant two things —
where the camera goes, and who owns the input. The pentagon engraving
wants both, which hid the conflation. Hyperbolic rendering wants a
camera placement on *every* frame while walking, which exposed it.
`Biome.capturesInput` is now its own question.

**Signs are pinned by agreement, not by argument.** Turning and strafing
are walked in both representations and the view matrices compared
against `geometry.HyperbolicWalker`, which is what the played-and-
validated Phase 0 room turns with. A wrong sign here does not crash — it
mirrors a plausible world, and the harness shipped exactly that bug once
with every test of the day passing through it. The `HyperbolicView`
tests were also mutation-checked rather than assumed: flipping the
frame's third leg fails four of six.

**What the biome reuses that is wrong for it, and why it is not.**
`PaintingModel.triggeredBy` measures ambient Euclidean distance, which
is meaningless between two hyperboloid coordinates — but exactly right
against a painting at the model origin, since rotational symmetry about
the hyperboloid's axis makes Euclidean distance *to the origin* strictly
increasing in hyperbolic distance to it. Checked in `SprawlBiomeTest`
across eight directions and four distances rather than left as prose.

Collision uses `space.distance`; ℝ³ distance between these coordinates
grows like `cosh` of the real one. It blocks rather than slides, left
until there are walls worth sliding along.

Verified by screenshot at two spawn distances — home is a distant sliver
at 2.2 intrinsic units and fills the foreground at 0.55 — which confirms
the per-frame view isometry is actually applied rather than the world
being drawn from a fixed origin. **Walking it is still unverifiable here
and remains the real test.**

Also logged: `Space.rightOf` is named for the opposite of the side it
returns (Heaps' camera is left-handed; `GameLoop` negates at the strafe
site). Pre-existing, now spread across one more implementation, and in
`docs/open/bug-tracker.md` rather than fixed here — correcting it also flips
`Camera.applyTo`'s pitch axis in every existing biome.

## 2026-08-16 — The Ribbon, and two things that only a build could tell us

`biomes.ribbon.RibbonBiome`: Rule 110's spacetime diagram as walkable
terrain, generation by generation, so walking north walks into the past.
The oldest generation is a single cell with a monolith on it, and past
that the ground stops. It is the only biome that does not tick.

The automaton (`RibbonAutomaton`) is fifteen lines and tested against
hand-computed opening generations plus Rule 90's symmetry — worth doing
because a neighbourhood indexed backwards would quietly be a different
rule, and the diagram would still look like a plausible automaton.

**The design called this "trivially cheap — an elementary CA is a few
lines, and the rendering is a heightfield."** Right about the automaton,
wrong about the rendering, in two ways that only showed up on screen.

**The terrain did not render at all, silently.** ~7,300 live cells at
twenty vertices each is ~146,000, past the 65,535 a 16-bit index buffer
can address. Heaps raised nothing and WebGL reported nothing; the
indices wrapped and the strip drew as a bare plane — indistinguishable
from geometry that was never generated. Found by shrinking the diagram
until the cells reappeared. Fixed by splitting live cells across meshes
under the limit.

**Worth remembering beyond this biome:** nothing in the codebase guards
against this. `biomes.sprawl.SprawlBiome` builds far more geometry and
stays clear only because it culls to a draw distance first. Any static
mesh over a few thousand boxes needs the same treatment.

**Flat ground did not deliver the space's own legibility law.**
`world-and-threads.md` promises "the past is terrain; you can see where
you came from, literally, as landscape". At walking eye height a
1.6-unit relief on 6-unit cells foreshortens to well under a pixel at
any distance, and the whole history read as one uniform grey plane —
confirmed by screenshot before and after. The strip now descends into
the past, turning the diagram into a hillside the player looks down
across. That is the stated law rather than a workaround for it, and it
costs nothing: a tilted plane is intrinsically flat, so this is still a
κ = 0 space.

Two consequences followed. The spawn pitches down the slope, because
looking level from the top of a hill is looking at sky. And live cells
are inset within their tiles, so adjacent ones read as cells instead of
merging into one expanse — the same trick the Sprawl's floor already
uses.

**Still open, and not checkable from here:** whether the history reads
*as* a history while walking it, rather than as abstract terrain. The
screenshots say it is legible; they cannot say it is meaningful.

## 2026-08-16 — The quotient framework

`geometry.DeckGroup` and `geometry.DeckGroups`: a discrete group of
isometries acting on the universal cover, which is how three of the
design's spaces stop being three separate builds. The Repeat is E²
modulo a lattice, the Turn is E² modulo a glide reflection, the Knot is
H² modulo the genus-2 surface group. Same machinery, different matrices.

**The design bet this pays off.** `roadmap.md` claimed "nine geometries
are nine parameter sets, not nine hand-built levels". This is where most
of that is actually collected: each space contributes four or fewer
matrices and gets folding, enumeration and rendering copies for free.

**The player never leaves the cover.** Movement, collision and rendering
happen in the unwrapped plane, where everything is ordinary. The
quotient shows up in exactly two places — `canonicalise` (fold a
position back near the origin) and `elementsWithin` (which copies to
draw). A torus therefore needs no special case anywhere in movement.

`Isometry` gained two things. `reflection`, the first
orientation-reversing element in the package and unavoidable for a
non-orientable quotient, since every product of translations and
rotations has determinant +1. And a general `invert`, exact by group
structure rather than by matrix inversion — `J·Mᵀ·J` for sphere and
hyperbolic, with its own case for flat, where `J = diag(1,1,0)` is
singular and that identity says nothing. `HyperbolicView.invert` now
delegates to it, and its walker-agreement tests passing unchanged is
independent evidence the general version is correct.

**A mutation test disproved my own documentation.** I wrote that the
glide reflection's composition order mattered — that reversing it gave a
half-turn and a silently orientable quotient. Swapping the operands
changed nothing at all, because a reflection commutes with a translation
along its own axis. The real hazard is the *axis*: reflecting about `y`
instead of `x` fails three tests. Collapsing the torus lattice onto a
single axis fails four. Corrected in place, with the false hazard
replaced by the true one.

**Genus-2 is deliberately absent.** The framework is curvature-generic
and takes it unchanged, but constructing the octagon's side-pairing
transformations correctly is real hyperbolic geometry and deserves its
own verification pass — not to be smuggled in beside two flat groups
whose correctness can be checked exhaustively against a direct lattice
count.

**Also noted, and not acted on:** `biomes.mobius.MobiusBiome` embeds a
twisted strip in ℝ³, which has real curvature everywhere. The Turn is
filed under κ = 0. A flat strip quotiented by a glide reflection is the
honest model — flat, non-orientable, with the twist in the
identification rather than in the geometry — and that is what
`DeckGroups.mobiusBand` provides when the Turn is built.

## 2026-08-16 — The Repeat, and a framework deliberately not used

`biomes.repeat.RepeatBiome`: a low-poly cell city tiled across the
plane, in which every tile carries the same layout and a few are missing
exactly one building. The gap is walkable ground the last tile did not
have, with a fragment standing in it.

**Sameness is structural, not maintained.** The generator reads only a
plot's position *within* a tile — the tile's own coordinates are
deliberately absent from the hash — so two tiles cannot differ unless
something explicitly makes them. That is the determinism argument the
design rests the whole mechanic on, expressed as code rather than as
discipline.

**`geometry.DeckGroup` is not used here, one commit after building it
for exactly this shape.** `world-and-threads.md` is explicit that a true
quotient has one tile rendered many times, so there is nothing to
compare and no mechanic. The framework's first real customer will be the
Turn. Worth recording because the omission would otherwise read as an
oversight by anyone who saw the two commits next to each other.

Divergences only ever *remove* a building. An addition is a difference
you can only look at; the design requires recognising it and reaching
new ground to be the same act.

**Two things were wrong when looked at, and both were invisible to a
green test suite.** Towers to 110 units with twelve-unit streets made a
slot canyon — fatal here specifically, since the mechanic is comparison
against a remembered skyline and there was no skyline to remember. And
the spawn searched outward in whole-plot steps from the tile's centre,
which (plot centres being at half-plot offsets) put every candidate on a
plot *boundary* nine units from a wall, filling half the first frame
with a building.

`game.BoxBatch` was extracted from `RibbonMesh` on the second use,
carrying the 16-bit index-buffer splitting that silently ate the
Ribbon's terrain. **The Ribbon was re-screenshotted after the move**
rather than trusted to its tests: its original bug rendered an empty
plane with every test passing, so a green suite is not evidence about
that biome's geometry. It came back pixel-identical.

**Still open:** whether walking one period and comparing is actually
satisfying, which is the only question that matters here and cannot be
answered from a screenshot.

## 2026-08-16 — The Turn, built in the order the design demanded

`biomes.turn.TurnBiome`: a flat strip quotiented by a glide reflection.
**The honest Möbius band** — `biomes.mobius.MobiusBiome` embeds a
twisted strip in ℝ³, which carries real curvature everywhere and so
teaches the wrong lesson for a space filed under κ = 0. Putting the
twist in the identification rather than the geometry gives something
intrinsically flat and genuinely non-orientable. Both are kept.

**The first real customer of `geometry.DeckGroup`.** The Repeat, built
for the same framework, turned out to need separate-but-identical tiles;
here the quotient is the point.

**The design's own entry says which problem comes first** — the
chirality mechanism cannot be judged until traversal is proven, "a bad
ribbon kills a good mechanic here" — so this build is the ribbon: 2.4x
speed, obstacles to weave on a rhythm, and that rhythm arriving mirrored
each lap so the second lap is not the first lap again. The
glider-annihilation puzzle is deliberately absent.

**A conceptual correction I made to my own work mid-build.** I painted
the two rails differently and wrote that the bright one "moves to your
other side" after a lap. That treats the edges as two objects. A Möbius
band has **one** boundary curve: the glide carries one edge onto the
other, so what look like two rails are a single curve of twice the
band's period, and painting its halves differently is a consistent
decoration of one object. Same visible behaviour, correct reason. The
top-down diagnostic view — where the rails visibly change places at the
seam — is that fact rendered. `testTheBandHasASingleBoundaryCurve` pins
it.

That correction also improves the proposal it belongs to: "which rail is
beside me" reads out **which lift the player is on**, which is exactly
the handedness the design wants legible, rather than a coincidence about
sides.

Mutation-checked: dropping the reflection from the wrap gives a cylinder
that walks identically and looks identical from any single vantage — the
space's entire lesson missing with no symptom — and fails three tests.

**Two things were wrong when looked at, both invisible to tests.** The
spawn sat twenty-five units from an obstacle and dead in line with it,
so the first frame was a grey slab. And the far rail was invisible
against a dark floor and darker void, which is fatal for a tell needing
*two* references; the rails now differ in **shape** as well as value,
which is also what the art direction says should carry a flat biome.

**Still open, and the whole point:** whether going round repeatedly is
actually pleasant. That is this space's own kill criterion and it cannot
be answered from a screenshot.

## 2026-08-16 — The Weft, and a presence set that looked like a map

`biomes.weft.WeftBiome`: the Fold's own sphere with an authored rule
laid over it — every wall answers to the wall at its antipode, always in
the opposite state. Close the door in front of you and one opens on the
far side of the world. Nothing is glued; there is exactly one player and
every place is where you would expect.

The echo — a pale marker at `-pos`, phasing through walls — is the
instrument the design's legibility law asks for. Verified by pitching
the spawn camera up toward the antipode: it is standing there on the far
side, and the far hemisphere reads clearly through the sphere's interior.

**What this reuses says as much as what it adds.** Sphere, grid, carve,
collision, wall mesh, exit painting: all the Fold's, untouched. New: one
file of pairing rules plus the echo. That ratio *is* the design's claim
about this space — the difference between the Fold and the Weft is
entirely an authored correspondence over identical geometry.

**A real bug, caught by the tests on their first run.**
`GridData.openEdges` is typed `StringMap<Bool>` and is actually a
**presence set**: `GridModel.isOpen` asks `exists`, never `get`, so the
stored boolean is never read. Writing `set(key, false)` to close a wall
left it reading as open — 469 failing assertions, immediately, with the
right message ("the wall itself did not flip"). Closing now removes the
key. Worth knowing beyond this biome: any future code that writes to a
layout must remove rather than write `false`.

**The pole edge case the design predicted, exactly where it predicted
it.** Rows nearest each pole carry an odd column count (`COLS/4` = 7),
and the antipodal map shifts a row by half its columns — landing on a
cell boundary on an odd row. No fixed-point-free pairing of an odd
number of cells exists at all, so those rows are unpaired. A test pins
which rows, so a change to `colsForRow` fails loudly rather than
silently widening the dead zone.

**A correction to my own comment, disproved by looking.** I wrote that
`enforceOpposite` takes one hemisphere as authoritative. It chooses per
antipodal *pair* by edge key, so authoritative edges are scattered over
the whole sphere. The per-hemisphere result — the far side is the
photographic negative of the near side — holds anyway.

And a thing I expected to be wrong that was not: I assumed the negative
hemisphere would be a nearly-open plain. Both sides read as mazes,
because a spanning-tree carve opens about half a grid's edges and so
does its complement.

**Left standing:** the rule destroys the carve's connectivity guarantee,
so the negative side can hold sealed pockets. Survivable, because the
verb here is opening walls — a player enclosed anywhere paired can
toggle out. A Weft with an authored puzzle will need its own generator.

## 2026-08-16 — The Defect, and numbered warp gates

`biomes.defect.DefectBiome`: a plain flat everywhere except one point.
Loop the apex and you come back turned by a quarter turn, having never
turned; loop beside it and nothing happens. **Eight of the design's nine
spaces are now walkable**, the Knot being the exception (it needs the
genus-2 group deferred from the quotient framework).

**It needed its own primitive, exactly as the design predicted.**
`CurvedSpace` covers the three uniform-curvature geometries and a cone
point is none of them. It is also *not* a `DeckGroup` quotient — the
group would be rotations about the apex, which have a fixed point, so
`elementsWithin` (pruning by how far an element moves the origin) would
enumerate infinitely many elements all of displacement zero. That was
worth discovering rather than assuming, since the framework had just
absorbed the Turn.

What it *is* structurally is the Möbius seam again, which the design
named correctly: the cone minus one ray is isometric to a wedge of the
plane, so the entire non-flat content is one rotation at one ray.

The holonomy is **measured**, not asserted — a circuit of small steps
carrying the heading, which between crossings is simply held constant
(in flat space that *is* parallel transport). Two loops give twice the
angle: the continuous dial the design wants, not a coin flip.

**My first version of that test was wrong, not the code.** It drove the
player through `2π` of chart angle — but one loop of a cone is
`CONE_ANGLE` — and it stepped by overwriting the position on a fixed
circle, discarding each wrap's own rotation of the position. Worth
recording because a wrong test that *fails* is cheap; the same mistake
in a test that passed would have been expensive.

**A compromise stated rather than hidden.** This space's legibility law
is "nothing is visibly bent", and a cone cannot be flattened. Markers
are drawn in a window centred on the player so everything in view is
continuous and correct, leaving a marker-free wedge behind the apex; the
ground is a full disc so there is no hole. A seamless cone renderer is
real remaining work.

### Numbered warp gates

Asked for directly. The debug room's portals now read "1. Fold", "2.
Weft" and so on, and the ring is **sorted** by that numbering — a number
that does not match the order you walk past them in is worse than none.
Pre-direction biomes keep their plain ids and sort last.

Two things the screenshot caught and the tests could not: the signs
**physically overlapped**, because the ring's circumference has to
exceed sign width times sign count and the count had gone from nine to
fourteen — labels looked truncated when they were being occluded. And
labels drop the design's leading "The", because `LabelTexture` scales
text to fit a fixed-width sign, so the longest name rendered at a
quarter the size of "wind".

## 2026-08-16 — The Knot, and all nine spaces walkable

`biomes.knot.KnotBiome`: a closed hyperbolic surface of genus 2. **This
completes the design's nine spaces** — every one of them can now be
walked in the game.

`geometry.DeckGroups.genusTwo` is the `{8,8}` tiling with opposite sides
identified: four hyperbolic translations by twice the octagon's
inradius, along alternate side-midpoint directions. The octagon's
interior angles are all `2π/8`, which is what lets eight meet at a
vertex and collapses all eight of its own vertices to one point; Euler
then fixes the genus at 2.

**Deferring this from the framework's first commit was the right call,
and the verification is why.** It is checked by computation rather than
by confidence in a half-remembered presentation:

- the orbit of the origin **matches the face centres of
  `HyperbolicTiling(8, 8)`**, built by entirely different means and
  independently tested against known ring populations;
- the action is **free** — as many elements as orbit points — so the
  quotient is a smooth surface rather than an orbifold;
- the element count matches a **Gauss-Bonnet** estimate derived from
  geometry alone (octagon area `4π`, disc area `2π(cosh R - 1)`, so
  about `(cosh R - 1)/2` octagons within `R`);
- each generator carries the *opposite* side onto the one it crossed,
  which is what makes it an identification rather than a neighbour step.

The biome reuses the Sprawl's spatial and rendering approach unchanged;
the only new thing is which group the copies come from. The consequence
showed up in the first screenshot: **the same landmark repeating in
several directions at once**, which is the design's legibility law
rendered rather than described. The landmark is asymmetric and
off-centre on purpose — with identical content in every image,
orientation is the only readable information.

**Caught before committing:** the first version called
`DeckGroup.elementsWithin` from `tick` and again from every fold — a
breadth-first search over the group, sixty times a second. The set never
changes, so it is enumerated once in the constructor.

### Where the direction stands

All nine spaces walkable: Still Life, Fold, Weft, Repeat, Turn, Defect,
Ribbon, Sprawl, Knot. What remains is no longer geometry — it is
content, and content wants mechanics confirmed by playing:

- the Turn's chirality puzzle, gated on whether repeated traversal is
  pleasant (that space's own stated kill criterion);
- the Repeat's composite mark, gated on whether comparison is satisfying;
- the Defect's socket and the Knot's braid, both gated on `CARRY`, which
  does not exist;
- the Weft's authored puzzle, which needs its own generator (carve,
  complement, repair) since the opposite-rule destroys connectivity;
- a seamless cone renderer for the Defect, the one place a legibility law
  is knowingly bent.

## 2026-08-17 — The Weft: no symmetry, no coherence, both fixed

Flagged directly ("I see no symmetry in the maze, nor any coherence with
our new Artistic Direction") and both complaints traced to the same root
cause: the Weft's own class doc claimed it reused "the Fold's" sphere,
grid and wall mesh, untouched. It doesn't. It reuses `biomes.common.grid`
and `biomes.maze` — the lat/long grid and generic spanning-tree maze that
predate the whole direction — never the numbered Fold (`biomes.conway`,
the icosahedral automaton sphere). The mixup mattered: it meant nobody
had checked the Weft against the actual art direction, because the docs
said it didn't need checking.

**Symmetry.** `WeftModel.enforceOpposite` satisfied the opposite-state
invariant by comparing edge keys — arbitrary, so which side of an
antipodal pair was "authoritative" scattered across the whole sphere with
no relationship a player standing anywhere could perceive. Replaced with
a hemisphere split: the northern half is carved freely, the southern half
is forced to its exact complement. `antipodeOf` maps row `r` to row
`13 - r`, so this split is total except the single row boundary sitting
exactly on the equator (rows 6 and 7, average theta exactly π/2), which
keeps the old edge-key tie-break as a small, honest seam rather than a
false hemisphere read. A new test
(`testTheNorthernHemisphereGeneratesAndTheSouthernMirrorsIt`) pins the
property directly against the pre-enforcement layout, which the old
scattered rule could never have passed.

**Coherence.** The maze rendered in the prototype's own grass and stone —
organic, and hue with no relation to curvature, direct violations of
art-and-audio.md's two universal constants. New `WeftMesh` reuses
`GridMesh`'s verified geometry (`buildFloorPrim`/`buildWallPrim`, split
out of `build`/`buildWalls` without changing their own behaviour) and
applies a flat amber/ember/brass palette instead: dim matte floor, and a
brighter wall in the *same* hue family — value carries the
active/scenery distinction, since hue is reserved for curvature alone.
Screenshotted pitched up across the sphere's interior to confirm: reads
as cells now, not a lawn.

Both fixes are small and load-bearing rather than a rewrite — the
pairing rule, the collision, the grid topology and the echo are all
untouched. What changed is which edge a pair trusts, and what a wall
looks like once you can act on it.

**Left for a separate pass, not silently fixed here:** `biomes.conway`'s
own actual palette (`ConwayMesh`/`GeodesicMesh`) is a cool cyan/green
"Tron" register, not the warm amber/ember/brass art-and-audio.md's master
rule prescribes for κ>0. The Weft now follows the *written* direction
faithfully; the Fold itself does not yet, and reconciling that is a
larger, riskier change than this one — it touches the game's most
finished space rather than its least.

## 2026-09-03 — Deploy automation: the open question, closed by platypod's Flux migration

The 2026-07-15 "Pre-commit hooks & web deployment" entry left
deployment-to-prod deliberately undecided,
between a manual `make deploy MODULE=games ENV=prd`, an in-cluster GitOps
setup, and a small scoped webhook receiver. It was judged then that GitOps was
"real infrastructure work spanning the `stack`/`infra` repos… not something to
introduce as a side effect of shipping one game."

That work happened anyway, for its own reasons: platypod's `stack` migrated to
**Flux CD**, prod cutting over 2026-08-24, with the `dev`/`main` deploy split
following 2026-09-02. So the option that was too expensive to adopt *for this
game* arrived for free, and the question is closed on the GitOps answer.

What that means concretely for unbegotten:

- Tag → GitHub Actions → `ghcr.io/platypod/unbegotten:<tag>` is unchanged.
- `stack` declares an `ImageRepository` for the image plus two policies —
  `unbegotten` (final releases only) and `unbegotten-local` (range ending
  `-0`, so `-dev.N` prereleases match).
- `image-automation-controller` writes the resolved pin to `stack`'s `dev`
  branch. Local tracks `dev`; prod tracks `main`; merging `dev` into `main`
  *is* the prod deploy.
- The driving constraint — never store a cluster credential in GitHub — holds
  by construction rather than by discipline: the cluster pulls, GitHub is
  never given anything to push with.

`make deploy` no longer exists in `stack` at all, so the manual option isn't
merely unchosen, it's gone.

Separately, the game was **enabled on the local cluster** for the first time on
this date. Enabling is distinct from shipping an image: each service has an
`enable` flag in the private `platypod-sops` repo
(`clusters/<env>/secrets.enc.yaml`, SOPS/age-encrypted), and that Secret is the
last `valuesFrom` entry on every `HelmRelease`, so it overrides the chart
default. `v0.15.2` came up behind Authelia at `unbegotten.platypod.local`.

`README.md` §Deployment and `docs/rules/guidelines.md` §6.3 have been rewritten
accordingly; both previously described the deferred state.
