/**
	**The Defect** — a plain that is flat everywhere except one point. See
	[the design](../../../docs/game/world.md)'s
	own entry (`### 5. The Defect`), which calls it the most underrated
	space in the set, and is right for a reason worth restating: it is the
	one place that makes a player understand what curvature *is*.

	Walk a closed loop that **encloses the apex** and you come back turned
	by a quarter turn, having never turned. Walk a closed loop that does
	not, and nothing happens. Curvature is concentrated rather than
	spread, and parallel transport is path-dependent — demonstrable in
	about forty seconds of walking, with no text.

	**How to see it**, since nothing announces itself: line yourself up
	with the meridian — the one straight line of posts running out from
	the apex — walk a wide circuit around the apex, and come back to it.
	The line will not be where your body expects. Do the same circuit
	*beside* the apex instead of around it and the line is exactly where
	you left it. That contrast is the whole lesson.

	**What is deliberately absent.** The design's socket — the one that
	only accepts a pattern arriving at an exact facing, with no in-place
	editing to correct it — is not built. That is the payload, and it
	needs `CARRY`, which does not exist yet. What is here answers the
	prior question: does concentrated curvature read, from inside, as
	anything at all.

	**The known rendering compromise**, stated because the design's own
	legibility law for this space is *"the space looks entirely ordinary,
	nothing is visibly bent"*, and this build does not fully honour it. A
	cone cannot be flattened; something must give. Markers are drawn in a
	window centred on the player so everything they can see is continuous
	and correct, which leaves a marker-free wedge directly behind the apex
	(see `DefectModel.drawAngleFor`). The ground is a full disc, so there
	is no hole. A seamless cone renderer — developing the visible
	neighbourhood properly — is real remaining work, not a tuning pass.
