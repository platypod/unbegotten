/**
	The Turn's band: a flat strip of the plane, identified with itself by
	a single glide reflection.

	**This is the honest Möbius band, and `biomes.mobius.MobiusBiome` is
	not.** That biome embeds a strip in ℝ³ and twists it, which looks
	right and *is not flat* — an embedded twisted strip carries real
	curvature everywhere, so walking it teaches the wrong lesson for a
	space `docs/game/world.md` files under
	κ = 0. Quotienting a flat strip by a glide reflection puts the twist
	in the **identification** rather than in the geometry: intrinsically
	flat, genuinely non-orientable, which is exactly the distinction the
	space exists to teach. The two biomes are left side by side rather
	than one replacing the other, since the embedded one is a different
	(and prettier) thing to look at.

	**The first real customer of `geometry.DeckGroup`.** The Repeat, built
	for the same framework, turned out to need separate-but-identical
	tiles rather than a quotient — see `biomes.repeat.RepeatModel`. Here
	the quotient is the point, and the group is doing genuine work: the
	glide's own sign conventions come from tested code rather than from a
	hand-written `(x + period, −y)` that would be one typo away from an
	orientable cylinder.

	**Coordinates.** The band lies in the world's XZ plane, so model `x`
	runs *along* the band and model `y` runs *across* it, mapping to world
	`z`. World `y` is height, which the quotient never touches.

		you are on, so that *the path you choose determines what arrives*.
		This is that, in the smallest honest form: a barrier across the
		middle of the band, solid on one lift and gone on the other. Walk a
		lap and the glide puts you on the other lift, and the gate you could
		not pass is open.

		**Deliberately a shortcut and not a lock.** The band is wide and the
		gate spans only its middle, so there is always a way around and the
		player can never be trapped by a mechanic that has not been
		playtested — which matters more here than usual, since this space's
		own entry in `world.md` says the setup is "not yet sold" and the
		exit is otherwise the only way out. A gate that costs you a detour
		teaches the same rule as a gate that stops you, and fails safe.

		Placed midway between two obstacles so it is met on the racing line
		rather than tucked away: you are supposed to run into it on the
		first lap, find it closed, and only later notice it is open — the
		"oh, *I* changed" the space exists for.
