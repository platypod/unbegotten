/**
	A dev-only flat room with one labelled portal per biome, and where the
	player starts — so trying out whichever biome is currently being worked on
	is two seconds of walking rather than an edit to `game.GameLoop`'s own
	startup call (which is how it was done until now: `enterBiome` pointed at
	whichever biome was under development, and got changed back and forth).

	Deliberately *not* the real hub. `biomes.hub.HubBiome` is a designed place
	with structures, an hourglass and a story job; it earns its layout, and
	adding "and also every biome has a plain sign here" to it would spoil
	exactly what makes it diegetic. This one is scaffolding: a flat floor, a
	ring of signs, no atmosphere, and it should be as boring as possible so
	nobody mistakes it for content.

	Flat rather than spherical (`FlatSpace`, the same topology the tower's
	shaft uses) for the same reason: a sphere is a *feature*, and the debug
	room shouldn't have any.

	The portals are ordinary `PaintingModel` warps, so they behave exactly
	like every real biome transition — including arriving as `returning`,
	which is what a painting warp always is (see `Biome.spawnPlayer`).
